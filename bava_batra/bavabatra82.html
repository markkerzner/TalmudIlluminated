If he does not own the land, he brings the first fruit, but cannot recite the verses. Why not? One should be allowed to recite Torah verses!  - Either because his words "... <a href = "null">the Land that You gave me</a> ..." will have the appearance of falsehood, or because he may regard his fruit as definite first fruit, and because of that neglect his tithe obligations. <br/></body></html>
