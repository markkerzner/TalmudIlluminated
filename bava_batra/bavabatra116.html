Yochanan said in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, "Whoever does not leave behind a son to inherit him, the Holy One, Blessed be He is full of anger toward him." <br/> <br/> From where do we know this? "... <a href = "http://bible.cc/numbers/27-8.htm">If a man dies and he has no son, and you will pass (veha'avartem) his inheritance</a> ..." and "evrah" means <a href = "http://bible.cc/zephaniah/1-15.htm">a day of anger</a>, as in "... <a href = "http://bible.cc/zephaniah/1-15.htm">a day of anger</a> ..." <br/> <br/> But is it a son or a student? Since Rabbi Yochanan lost his ten sons and would console people with "...look, this is a bone of my last son..." - it must be that he meant a student, for otherwise he would not publicize that God is angry with him. Then why did he say "son?" - These were the words of his teacher, but he himself felt that a man must leave a student. <br/> <br/> Art: John Frederick Lewis - A Turkish School in the Vicinity of Cairo <br/></body></html>
