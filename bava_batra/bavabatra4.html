" <a href = "null">Even in your thoughts do not curse a king</a> ..." H. But this man is not a king. B. "... <a href = "null">even in your bedroom do not curse the rich</a> ...", and "... <a href = "null">a prince among your people you shall not curse</a> ." H. If I knew that Sages were so circumspect, I would not have killed them. What is my remedy? B. Rebuild the Temple. <br/> And so King Herod started.</body></html>
