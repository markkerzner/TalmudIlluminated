Thus, one can change the the portion of whose who are in the same order of inheritance. This ruling contradicts <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-batra/bava-batra126.html">the one cited earlier</a> ; indeed, it is the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah and is the one accepted in practice. <br/> <br/> Art: Carl Larsson - Mother And Daughter <br/></body></html>
