In regard to ".. <a href = "http://bible.cc/leviticus/18-27.htm">all these</a> ..."  illicit  relationships, a shorter form of "these" - "el" is used, but in regard to false measures, "... <a href = "http://scripturetext.com/deuteronomy/25-16.htm">all who do these</a> ..." a longer form "eleh" is used. Why? One cannot remember all those he has cheated and return money to them. <br/> <br/> " <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/25-14.htm">You shall not have in your house false measures</a> ..." - why in your house? It is forbidden everywhere! This teaches that "you shall not have in your house" because of false measures. <br/> <br/> In some places it is a custom of sellers to add a little extra to the scale on which the produce is weighted, while in  others sellers add a little after weighing. One should not deviate from the prevailing custom, because it may lead an onlooker to make a mistake in the future. <br/></body></html>
