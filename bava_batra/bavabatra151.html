Whenever her health would worsen, she would transfer it to him as a sickbed gift, and when she would recover, she would retract the gift. <br/> <br/> One time, she felt weak and sent a message to him, "Come, acquire the orchard from me," but Rav Dimi did not come. She sent a message "Come, acquire it in any way you wish." Rav Dimi went and asked her to give him only a portion, and to perform a formal act of acquisition, <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-batra/bava-batra146.html">hoping to make the gift irreversible</a> . She did all that, then recovered and reneged on the gift, but Rav Dimi did not want to return it. <br/> <br/> She went to Rav Nachman, who ruled that since she said "Woe, I am dying!" she made the gift only under the impression that she was dying and thus may still retract. <br/> <br/> Art: Johannes Vermeer - Girl with a Red Hat <br/></body></html>
