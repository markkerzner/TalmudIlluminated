However, in money matters there is another principle that " to extract money from his fellow, the burden of proof lies with the claimant ," and it trumps the principle of majority. Since the buyer cannot definitely prove his claim, the seller does not have to refund the purchase amount. <br/> <br/> Painting: Louise Moillon - At the Market Stall <br/> <br/></body></html>
