The basic succession of heirs is thus as follows: a man's primary heir is his son. If there is no son, the estate reverts to the deceased man's daughter. After this the next eligible heir is the father of the deceased, and if there is no living father, the estate reverts to that father's own heirs. <br/> <br/> There are persons who can inherit and bequeath possessions, such as a son, who can inherits from his father, but also bequeath to him. There are also those persons who inherit but do not bequeath - such as a son and his mother - he can inherit from her, but the mother does not inherit from her son. <br/> <br/> Art: Francois Adolphe Grison - Disinherited <br/></body></html>
