The administration lasts only while the children are minors. The ruling applies only if he left over all his property to his wife, but if he left anything to his sons, the gift to his wife was genuine. <br/> <br/> Art: Ary Scheffer - Marie Joseph Marquise de La Fayette, on his Deathbed <br/> <br/></body></html>
