The reason was to encourage the Jews who entered the Land to conquer all of it from the Canaanite inhabitants - and not get it through intermarriage. <br/> <br/> The daughters of Tzelophchad were given the same commandment, but for them it was just good advice - because they were <a href = "null">wise</a> , <a href = "null">expounders of the Torah</a> , and <a href = "null">righteous</a> . Nevertheless, <a href = "null">they followed it</a> . Moreover, a miracle happened to them: they were rejuvenated and married righteous, fitting husbands. <br/> <br/> Art: Gerrit - Wedding Dance in a Tavern <br/></body></html>
