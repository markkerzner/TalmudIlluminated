Has the ill person retracted his entire gift to the first person, or has he retracted only the part of the gift that he explicitly willed to someone else? <br/> <br/> If it counts as complete retraction, then the first person receives nothing, whether the sick person dies or recovers, and the second person received his share: if the sick person recovers, as a gift, and if he dies, as inheritance. <br/> <br/> However, if it is partial retraction, then if the sick person dies, the two receive their shares, but if he recovers, both receive nothing - as in <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-batra/bava-batra146.html">the case of a sick person who leaves something over</a> . <br/> <br/> The law follows the first possibility. <br/> <br/> Art: Jehan Georges Vibert - The Sick Doctor <br/></body></html>
