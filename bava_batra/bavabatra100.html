As people were walking from the cemetery, the leader would say "Stand, dear ones, stand." Then he would say, "Sit, dear ones, sit," and they would sit and bemoan their loss. This was done seven times, corresponding to <a href = "http://bible.cc/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">seven "futilities" in Ecclesiastes</a>   and <a href = "http://bible.cc/genesis/8-22.htm">seven components in the cycle of times</a> . <br/> <br/> Art: Alfred   Sisley - Garden Path in Louveciennes <br/></body></html>
