Since it is unknown whether the tumtum is male or female,  he cannot claim more than the lesser of the two portions. He thus receives support until maturity, like the daughters. When the property is  meager, the females push him away to the males, and he receives nothing, like the other sons. <br/> <br/> Art: Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio - Narcissus <br/></body></html>
