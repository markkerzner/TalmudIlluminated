Rav says, "Once the buyer has pulled the ship even a small distance, he has acquired it." But Shmuel says, "He has not acquired the ship until he pulls it away completely away from the place it originally occupied." <br/> <br/> Is this the same disagreement as the two views on acquiring an animal by pulling: (1) the animal is acquired when it raises the front and hind leg, or (2) only when it walks the full length? <br/> <br/> No, it is not the same! Once the animal starts to move, it will move the other two legs, but the ship may stop after the initial push. On the other hand, once a ship is moved, it moves as a whole, whereas an animal can put its legs back. The two disagreements are different, and both had to be recorded. <br/> <br/> <br/></body></html>
