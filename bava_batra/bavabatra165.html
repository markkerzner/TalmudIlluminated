Did Rav really mean that everybody engages in negative speech daily? Rather, he meant a hint of negative speech by using body language and voice inflection. <br/> <br/> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said, "In a place where both open and bound documents are used, if one instructs to write an open one, but the scribe wrote a bound one, it is acceptable, because he only said it by way of example." <br/> <br/> Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai also subscribes to the "by way of example" idea, as in <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/kiddushin/kiddushin49.html">the case of a woman who appointed an agent to accept her betrothal money of a silver dinar, but the agent accepted a gold dinar</a> . She mentioned the silver dinar only by way of example, and she is betrothed with a golden dinar. <br/> <br/> Art: Louis Charles Moeller - The gossips <br/></body></html>
