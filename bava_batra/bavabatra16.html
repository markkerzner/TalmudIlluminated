When Satan saw that the Holy One, Blessed be He, was partial to Job, he said to himself, "God forbid that He will forget the mercy He has for Abraham." Therefore he set out to demonstrate Job's failings. <br/> <br/> Rav Acha bar Yakov taught this in the town of Papunia, and the Satan came and kissed his feet in appreciation.</body></html>
