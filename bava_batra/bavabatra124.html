Just as a gift cannot be given unless it has come into the donor's possession, so does the <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">double portion</a> include only present assets. <br/> <br/> Rebbi : the words "... <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">double portion</a> ..." make the law for both portions the same, to include future automatic benefits. <br/> <br/> George W.
