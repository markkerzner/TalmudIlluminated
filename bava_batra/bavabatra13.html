If they later want to exchange the portion, they are treated as buyers from each other. <br/> <br/> How does one divide a field that is bordered by a river on one side and a canal on the other? It is divided into eight sections, and each brother takes every other section, as shown in diagram 1. <br/> <br/> All the properties that are not large enough to be divided, what can one partner do if he still wants to separate? One of them sets the price, and the other is given an option of either buying his partner's share, or selling his share at this price.</body></html>
