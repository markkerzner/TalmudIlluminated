The donor says "I was sick when I wrote the document and I have since recovered, hence my recovery nullifies the gift," but the recipients say, "You were healthy, and the gift is therefore valid." <br/> <br/> The giver must bring proof that he was seriously ill - these are the words of Rabbi Meir, but the Sages say that since recipients wish to collect from the giver, who is presently in the possession of the property, they are the ones who must prove their claim. <br/> <br/> Art: H.
