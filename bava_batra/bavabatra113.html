Of course not! Rather, since it says, "... <a href = "null">this should be to the children of Israel as a statute of judgment</a> ..." inheritance has the laws of a court case. For example, if three people are visiting a sick person, who instructs them concerning his last will, they have two options: write it down as witnesses or act as judges of a court and execute the judgment - but only by day, since all court cases have to be started by day. <br/> <br/> Said Rabba Bar Chanina, "Yes, that is what I meant." <br/> <br/> Art: Edvard Munch - Death In The Sick Room <br/></body></html>
