Moreover, all the descendants of a son take precedence over a daughter. <br/> <br/> However, a daughter takes precedence over the brothers of the deceased (her uncles), and the descendants of a daughter take precedence over brothers. The daughter also takes precedence over the father of the deceased (her grandfather). <br/> <br/> This is the rule: whoever takes precedence in the inheritance, his descendants too take precedence; and the father takes precedence over all his descendants - because the brothers of the deceased are related to him through their common father. <br/> <br/> Art: Edvard Munch - By the Deathbed <br/></body></html>
