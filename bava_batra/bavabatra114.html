For how long? Rabbah said, "As long as they are seated at the same location." Rav Yosef said, "As long as there are talking about the same subject." <br/> <br/> However, both Rabbah and Rav Yosef have a problem with the rule learned previously about a <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-batra/bava-batra113.html">court executing the last will</a> . If a sick person can retract, none of their decisions are valid! Rav Yosef answers that this rule is only applicable while they are still talking about the subject of inheritance. <br/> <br/> Art: Antonio Paoletti - Fair Exchange <br/></body></html>
