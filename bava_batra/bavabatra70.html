Do we say that if the custodian wished to lie, he could have said that the deposit suffered an unavoidable mishap, in which case he would have been believed? Therefore, we believe him on the strength of "why would he lie?" argument? <br/> <br/> Or can the depositor ask, "Then why do I have this document in my hands?" - so "why would he lie?" is not applicable? <br/> <br/> Perhaps, the custodian didn't bother retrieving the document, because he knew that he could claim unavoidable mishap and would be believed. Therefore, he is believed now. <br/></body></html>
