When the property of the estate is meager, the daughters are supported and the sons go begging at the door. <br/> <br/> According to Biblical law, a person survived by his sons and daughters is inherited only by his sons. The Sages, however, instituted that a man stipulate to his wife in her marriage contract (ketubah) that their daughters who survive him be entitled to support from his estate until they marry or reach full maturity. <br/> <br/> Admon says, "Because I am male, do I lose?" and Rabban Gamliel prefers his opinion, but the final law follows the first authority - the daughters take priority. <br/> <br/> Art: John Greenwood - John Richard Comyns of Hylands Essex with his daughters <br/></body></html>
