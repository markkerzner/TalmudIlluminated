However, this opens a possibility of forgery. <br/> <br/> Should we be concerned that, having the witnesses already signed above, he will write an additional clause at the end of the document, beneficial to him? - No, because words "firm and established" are written at the end of a bound document. <br/> <br/> What if he erases the words "firm and established," adds to the document, then writes the words "firm and established" again? -Â  Additions do not invalidate the document, but erasures, even certified with "firm and established", do invalidate it. <br/> <br/> Art: John Turing - Still Life with Documents <br/></body></html>
