Rabbah bar bar Chanah signed two documents: notification that the sale was executed under duress, as well as the document of sale <br/> <br/> Said Rav Huna: both documents have legal force. But how can it be? Rather, what Rav Huna meant is that the forced sale would be valid, if not canceled by the prior notification - since it was Rav Huna who introduced <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/10/bava-batra-48-is-forced-action-valid.html">the forced sale rule</a> . <br/> <br/> But we have a <a href = "http://www.poetry-chaikhana.com/K/KhayyamOmar/51MovingFing.htm">rule that a witness, having testified, can't offer a new testimony contradicting his first one</a> . How could Rabbah sign on both documents? - Exactly! Since he signed on the notification of duress first, his signature on the document of sale becomes invalid.</body></html>
