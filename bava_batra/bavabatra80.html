These eggs hatch and produce one male and one female, which themselves begin to mate at the age of two months. <br/> <br/> In order to stay in the dovecote, the mother must have, in addition to her mate, her daughter as a companion. The daughter, too, must have her offspring as companions, since her mother is not company enough. The buyer must, therefore, leave all these pairs and not take them for himself. <br/></body></html>
