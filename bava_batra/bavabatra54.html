One who spreads out mats on the ownerless land of a deceased convert and lies down upon them has acquired the land. <br/> <br/> Proof <br/> <br/> One can acquire a Canaanite slave by means of a propriety act, such as having the slave put on a shoe for him, remove his shoe, or lift him. We see that supporting the weight is a propriety act - and so it is with land: spreading the mats and lying down on it constitutes a proprietary act. <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/kiddushin/kiddushin23.html">Compare this to a slave woman.</a> <br/></body></html>
