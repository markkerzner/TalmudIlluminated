While learning, the Sage may not have considered all aspects of the matter. A practical ruling, on the other hand, may be misunderstood by the observer as to the reason behind it. Rather, the Sage has to declare both that the law agrees with a certain view, and that it is to be followed in practice. <br/> <br/> Is the <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-batra/bava-batra130.html">ruling about changes in inheritance</a> true for someone on his deathbed, because of "... <a href = "null">on the day when he makes his sons inherit</a> ...", or even for a one who is young and healthy? Rebbi said (and some state, ruled in an actual case) that it works for a healthy person also. The two reports disagree on "is theory or practice more important." <br/> <br/> Art: Baron Mikhail Petrovich Klodt von Jurgensburg - Beside a Sick Woman <br/></body></html>
