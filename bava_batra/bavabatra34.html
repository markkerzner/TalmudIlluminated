There was one witness to the snatching, but the defendant said, "Yes, I snatched it, but it was my ingot that I snatched!" <br/> <br/> Rabbi Ami considered the case: <br/> <br/> * Should he be required to pay? But there aren't two witnesses! <br/> * Exempt him based on "Why would he lie?" -Â  he could deny having snatched it altogether? This argument is weakened by the witness. <br/> * Make him swear that he did not snatch it? But he himself admits that he did! <br/> * Make him swear that the ingot was his? We can't concoct oaths! <br/> <br/> Rav Abba offered a solution. The snatcher is obligated to take an oath but can not do so, and all such people must pay. <br/></body></html>
