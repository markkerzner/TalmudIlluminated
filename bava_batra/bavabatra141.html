If she gives birth to a tumtum (a person of indeterminate gender), he does not get anything, but if he is the only child - he inherits all. <br/> <br/> So the man prefers a daughter? But we learned that <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-batra/bava-batra116.html">one should leave a son</a> ! Either he realizes that a daughter needs more, or he follows the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah that a <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-batra/bava-batra17.html">daughter is a blessing</a> . <br/> <br/> But how can an unborn child acquire a gift? This follows the opinion of Rabbi Yossi that a fetus inherits, and <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-batra/bava-batra130.html">the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah that a will made to the one who inherits is valid</a> . <br/> <br/> Art: Henri-Fran√ßois Riesener - Mother and Her Daughter <br/></body></html>
