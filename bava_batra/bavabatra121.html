On that day: <br/> <br/> * The tribes were allowed to intermarry with each other; <br/> * The tribe of Benjamin was allowed to marry members of the other tribes; <br/> * Those destined to die in the Wilderness ceased to die; <br/> * Jews were allowed to go on the pilgrimage festivals; <br/> * The slain of Bethar were afforded burial; <br/> * They stopped chopping trees for the Altar. <br/> <br/> Art: John White Alexander - Repose <br/></body></html>
