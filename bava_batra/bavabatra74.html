I went and saw that scorpions surrounded it, and they resembled white donkeys. I heard a Heavenly voice saying, "Woe to me (God) that I have sworn to exile My people; and now that I have sworn, who can annul the oath for Me?" <br/> <br/> When Rabbah came back, the Rabbis told him,Â  - Every Abba (his proper name) is a donkey, and every bar bar Chanah is a fool. You ought to have declared, "It is annulled for You." <br/> <br/> And Rabbah, what did he think? That perhaps the Heavenly voice was talking about <a href = "http://bible.cc/genesis/8-21.htm">the oath about the Flood</a> . <br/> <br/> And the Rabbis? If so, then why did the Heavenly voice say "Woe is to Me" about something that is for mankind's good? <br/> <br/> <br/></body></html>
