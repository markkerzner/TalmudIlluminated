From this we learn that there was not one other person who entered the Land who did not take a portion. And if you think that only successful petitions were recorded, like the one of the <a href = "http://bible.cc/numbers/27-1.htm">daughters of Tzelophchad</a>, then the petition of the <a href = "http://bible.cc/joshua/17-14.htm">descendants of Joseph</a> will prove you wrong, for they <a href = "http://bible.cc/joshua/17-15.htm">did not get it granted</a> . <br/> <br/> Joshua and Calev took the portions of the spies in the Land. We learn it from "... <a href = "http://bible.cc/numbers/14-38.htm">they lived from among the spies</a> ..." We already know that they did not die from "... <a href = "http://bible.cc/numbers/26-65.htm">and not a man was left of them exept for Calev and Joshua</a> ...", so what does the extra "live" tell us? That they lived in the portions of the spies. <br/> <br/> Art: Grant Wood - Daughters of the Revolution <br/> <br/></body></html>
