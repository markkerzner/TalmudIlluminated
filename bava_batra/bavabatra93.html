Others say that the seller is required to pay also the buyer's expenses. <br/> <br/> Who are these others? It is Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel, who issued the following ruling: "If one takes wheat to a miller, and the miller did not moisten it before grinding and, as a result, processed it into bran, and the baker processed it into crumbly bread - he must pay the customer also the value of his embarrassment and the embarrassment of his guests - and such was a great custom that existed in Jerusalem." <br/> <br/> Painting: Georg Flegel - Still-Life with Bread and Confectionary <br/></body></html>
