In discussing the laws of inheritance, it says "... <a href = "null">and you shall give his inheritance to â€¦ his flesh and he shall inherit her</a> ..." and "his flesh" means his wife, because "... <a href = "null">they shall become one flesh</a> ..." <br/> <br/> In connection with this, there was a <a href = "null">commandment for a Jewish woman to marry only within her tribe</a> . The commandment was in force only during the years of conquest of the Land of Israel. It was applicable only to a woman who could potentially inherit land at the time of marriage - that is, if she had no brothers and was thus her father's prospective heir. <br/> <br/> Art: Amedeo Modigliani - The Sculptor Jacques Lipchitz and His Wife Berthe Lipchitz <br/></body></html>
