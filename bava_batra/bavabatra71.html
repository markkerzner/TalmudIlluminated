These items are not included in the sale, even if they are in disuse at the time of the sale. <br/> <br/> When one gives the primary item as a gift, he gives it all, and even items not included in the case of sale. A gift recipient is embarrassed to ask about details, and it is on the giver to withhold any items he wants to keep. <br/> <br/> One who consecrates a field is generous like a giver. Rabbi Shimon says, he is like a seller. <br/></body></html>
