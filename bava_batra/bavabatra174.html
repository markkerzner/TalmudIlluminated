Only when the guarantor accepts a higher responsibility with the language like "give him the money, and I accept on myself the payment" can the lender go to the guarantor without attempting to collect from the borrower. <br/> <br/> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that even in that case the lender cannot do it, but this is one of the <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-batra/bava-batra174.html">three</a> cases where the law does not follow him. <br/> <br/> Art: Quiringh Gerritsz. van Brekelenkam - Interior with a smoking and a drinking man by a fire <br/></body></html>
