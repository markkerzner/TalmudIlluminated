It is thus written "... <a href = "null">in the house of Achav every one who urinates against a wall</a> ...", meaning every male, which implies that this is a normal practice. <br/> <br/> But we have learned a rule that a person may not pour water or urine at the side of his fellow's wall closer than three hand-breadths from the wall! Answers Rabbah: pouring from a pot is not allowed, but urinating is. <br/> <br/> But another rule states that a person may not urinate next to his fellow's brick wall closer than 3 hand-breadths and 1 hand-breadth from a stone wall! Rabbah is disproved. But he quoted a verse! The verse is saying that Achav will not even have dogs. <br/></body></html>
