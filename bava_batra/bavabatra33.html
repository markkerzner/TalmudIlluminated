Abaye said to him, "Tell me, what are the circumstances?" <br/> <br/> Rava explained, "I was holding their father's land as security for loan repayment and collecting the harvest. When the loan was thus completely paid, I still kept the land, because their father owed me another loan." <br/> <br/> "Had I returned the land, I would  be able to collect the second loan only with an oath, and it is proper to <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">avoid even truthful oaths</a> .  You should believe me on the strength of the 'Why would he lie?' argument, for I could have said a better lie, that I bought that land." <br/> <br/> Abaye ruled, "The rumor functions as protest and ruins your chazakah, the three years of which count only without protests. Therefore, return the land." <br/></body></html>
