One does not bring <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/daf-in/daf-in100.html">first-fruit</a> from itÂ  - because it should be "... <a href = "null">from your field</a> ..." and because stolen produce in unfit for Temple service. <br/> <br/> Question against Ulla: Rabbi Akiva said, "Even a minute measure of land is <a href = "null">subject to the requirements</a> of first-fruit , and it is <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/daf-in/daf-in100.html">fit to write prosbul on its account</a> . <br/> <br/> Ulla answers: "Rabbi Akiva is talking about wheat, not a tree." Only wheat can grow on a minute measure of land. <br/> <br/> However, one of Yehoshua's conditions when dividing Israel was that the practice of planting trees near the border should be tolerated by neighbors, thus making the first-fruit fit.</body></html>
