What is the reason behind their argument? <br/> <br/> Rav Dimi says that the deed was in the name of a third party, and the argument is whether the transfer of the deed also transfers property. Abaye says that invalid witnesses signed, and the argument is which witnesses accomplish the transfer - those that sign or those that see it. Râ€™ Avina (Ravina) says that they argue whether one who made a superfluous claim is now required to corroborate it, with Rebbi saying "no" and Rabbi Shimon saying "yes." <br/> <br/> Art: Wybrand Hendriks - Notary Kohne and His Clerk</body></html>
