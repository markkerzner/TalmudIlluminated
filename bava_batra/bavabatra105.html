The second statement nullifies the first. If it was uttered after a while, it is definitely a retraction. Even if it was uttered right away, we assume that he changed his mind. These are the words of Ben Nannas. <br/> <br/> However, the Sages say that since he added nothing to clarify his retraction, this may indicate that he understood the contradiction and went back to the first statement - and decided to stop talking and making further mistakes.
