In the Temple, however, birds were an exception, and there they were killed in a different way, called <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-64-bird-sin-offering-and-burnt.html">melikah</a> . While shechitah is done from the front of the neck, the <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-64-bird-sin-offering-and-burnt.html">melikah</a> is done from the back of it. Therefore we have the following rules. <br/> <br/> If one performs shechitah from the side of the neck, it is valid, but if one performs <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-64-bird-sin-offering-and-burnt.html">melikah</a> from the side of the neck, it is invalid. If one performs shechitah from the back of the neck, it is invalid, but if he performs <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-64-bird-sin-offering-and-burnt.html">melikah</a> from the back of the neck, it is the proper way to do it. Finally, if one performs shechitah from the throat, it is valid, but if he performs <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-64-bird-sin-offering-and-burnt.html">melikah</a> that way, it is invalid. <br/> <br/> We thus find that the complete back of the neck is valid for <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-64-bird-sin-offering-and-burnt.html">melikah</a>, and the complete front and the sides are valid for shechitah, and what is fit for <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/01/zevachim-64-bird-sin-offering-and-burnt.html">melikah</a> is unfit for shechitah and vice versa. <br/> <br/> Art: Jozef Chelmonski - Greeting Of The Sun Cranes</body></html>
