If a weasel struck (bit) it on its head in a place that makes it a terefah, that is, opposite the brain, and there is a concern that the brain membrane may have been punctured. If the gizzard was punctured, or if the intestines were punctured. <br/> <br/> If a fowl fell into fire and its internal organs were scorched, then if they turned green, it is terefah, but if they remained red, it is kosher. If one trod on a fowl or knocked it against the wall, or if an animal crushed it, then if it fluttered and remained alive for twenty-four hours, and one then slaughtered it, it is kosher. <br/> <br/> Art: Wallerant Vaillant - Young Sportsman with Rabbit and Fowl</body></html>
