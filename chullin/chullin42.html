This cannot mean that the animal already died by itself - for then it would be a case of nevelah, carcass. Rather, it is talking about an animal that is fatally wounded. Even if it was properly slaughtered, it is forbidden to be eaten as "<a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a>." The defect may be caused by an animal or a man, in any place, it can even be congenital, and "in the field" simply describes a common scenario. <br/> <br/> There are eight general categories of <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a> , taught to Moses on Sinai, and they can be arranged according to the Hebrew acronym of "dan chanak nefesh(דן חנק נףש)." They are: clawed, punctured, deficient, removed, torn, fallen, severed, and fractured. For practical purposes the classification of <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2011/07/terefah-and-nevelah-two-categories-of.html">terefah</a> was divided into eighteen cases, starting with an animal whose esophagus was punctured, one whose trachea was severed, whose brain was punctured, and so on. <br/> <br/> The laws that follow are complex, and the difficulty is compounded by the fact that not everybody knows the necessary details of the <a href = "http://www.animalcorner.co.uk/farm/cows/cow_anatomy.html">animal anatomy</a> .
