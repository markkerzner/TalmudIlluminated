Even if the animal is later slaughtered, the limb retains its prohibited status. This applies to both kosher and non-kosher animals - so say Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Elazar, but the Sages say that this prohibition applies only to kosher animals. <br/> <br/> Both opinions are derived from the same source. The Torah said, " <a href = "null">Only be strong not to eat blood, for the blood is the life, you shall not eat the life with the flesh</a> ." Just as blood is forbidden in kosher and non-kosher animals, so is the limb torn from a live animal - so say Rabbi Yehudah and Rabbi Elazar. And the Sages? They say that "You shall not eat the life with the flesh" indeed prohibits a limb, but it should be such an animal that "flesh without life" should be permitted - that is, a kosher animal, whose meat may be eaten. <br/> <br/> How much of a limb one has to eat to transgress? - An olive's volume. Alternatively, a complete limb, a "creation," even if smaller than an olive's volume, makes him liable also. <br/> <br/> Art: Paolo Antonio Barbieri - Still Life With Plates, A Sack Filled With Olives, Game, Pomegranates, And Quince</body></html>
