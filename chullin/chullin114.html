How do we know this for the milk of a cow or an ewe? - We can derive this logically: if the young goat's own mother, with whom he can have offspring, is nevertheless so strict that it is prohibited to cook him in its milk, then a cow, with whom he is not allowed to have offspring (for that would be prohibited interbreeding) - her milk certainly cannot be used to cook him! <br/> <br/> However, this logic is flawed. There is a stringency with the young goat and its mother: they cannot be killed on one day. This stringency is not found in regards to the goat kid and a cow who is a complete stranger to him. Thus, with our logic disproved, we need another way to derive the prohibition - and it is derived from the second repetition of " <a href = "null">don't cook a young goat in its mother milk</a> ," which, his mother being already prohibited, now teaches us the same law about a cow. <br/> <br/> Art: Richard Ansdell - Feeding Goats in the Alhambra</body></html>
