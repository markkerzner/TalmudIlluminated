The Sukkah should be a temporarily dwelling reminding him of the similar arrangements that his ancestors had in the desert, after going out of Egypt. Some say, it reminds him not of the physical dwellings which the Jews used in the desert, but rather the Heavenly clouds that surrounded them wherever they went.
<br />
<br />
According to either reason, Sukkah must be a temporarily dwelling, and its height cannot exceed twenty amot (about thirty feet). Why? If he builds the Sukkah that is higher, he must make it much stronger, thus his Sukkah would be invalid. Some say that in a Sukkah that is high he simply does not see its roof and forgets that he is in the Sukkah.<br />
<br />
Now, when we learned about Shabbat, we had a similar limitation: the height of an eruv bar, reminding people of the Shabbat boundaries where one cannot carry things also had to be less than twenty amot, and there one had to lower it. Why, when talking about Sukkah, we say that it is invalid if too high, but about eruv we are given an advice to lower it? We had a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/03/eruvin-2-houses-courtyard-alley.html">similar question about the Eruv</a>!. The details of the Sukkah construction that we have in front of will be very numerous; thus our teacher preferred to say that it is imply invalid, rather than offer all possible corrections.<br />
