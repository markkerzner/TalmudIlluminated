How much? The roof, called "s'chach" should be thick enough to block out more than half the sun. What if the makeshift walls don't go all the way to the roof and therefore let in the sun? - That does not matter. However, Rabbi Yoshiyah says that just as in a normal house the walls protect and shade you, so in the sukkah they must not let too much sun.
<br />
<br />
We see that Rabbi Yoshiyah requires some permanence in the construction of a sukkah. There are other Sages who also require permanence, as evidenced by their words in other areas. For example, Rabbi Yehudah validates a high sukkah, which would mean that its walls are sturdy and somewhat permanent; Rabbi Shimon requires four walls, and not just three; Rabban Gamliel does not allow a sukkah on a wagon or a car.
<br />
<br />
Can a sukkah be round? - No, because normal houses are not built like that. However, Rabbi Yochanan allows a round sukkah if it large enough for twenty four people to sit - since people do throw parties in this manner. The Talmud goes through multiple calculations to explain the twenty-four count.
