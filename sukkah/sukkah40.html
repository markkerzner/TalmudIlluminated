Buy why? If etrog is subject to Shmitah, so should be the lulav! Well, lulav did not begin growing in the fifteen days between Rosh HaShanah and Sukkot, when Shmitah really started.  But then the same can be said about the etrog! - No, the difference is that for palm tree its Shmitah starts when it is planted - which is before Shmitah, but for etrog - at the time of picking it, which is on Shmitah. 
<br />
<br />
The last explanation may work, but it seems artificial. Why do we even need to use it? The difference is simpler: citron is food, and palm branches are not. So the laws of Shmitah apply to one but not to the other. Actually, this is not so obvious. The laws of Shmitah are defined as "for you it will be for food." This includes foods, but it also includes anything that is for you, that is anything at all. How do we reconcile this? - We include anything like food. Just like with food, the act of destroying it and the act of enjoying it comes at the same time, so for example ointments are also included. But palm branches are excluded, because we burn them now, and use their hot coals for cooking later.
