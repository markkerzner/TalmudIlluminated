The customarily worshipped figures are those of a crowned king seated in a chariot - representing the sun, a similar allegorical figure of a moon, or a dragon - which some interpret as a serpent. The highly saline waters of the Dead Sea are not navigated by men, and there is little risk of anyone recovering and enjoying them. Rabbi Yehudah adds an image of a nursing woman, which was worshipped because of Eve, who nursed the entire world. <br/> <br/> Rabbi Elazar HaKappar once found a ring with a dragon on it. He found an adult idolater and forced him to nullify the idol. We see from here that a Jew cannot nullify an idol, that an adult idol worshipper can nullify even an idol that is not his, and even under duress. <br/> <br/> All this refers to using a found object, but prohibitions for a Jew to create an image are stricter, and one has to avoid even a suspicion of idol worship. <br/> <br/> Art: Odilon Redon - Apollos Chariot</body></html>
