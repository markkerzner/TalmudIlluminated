Rava, however, says that we consider the names, and grapes and wine have different names. Therefore, we consider the two foods different in nature, and if there are 60 times less wine than grapes, the mixture is permitted. <br/> <br/> Conversely, if wine vinegar and beer vinegar become mixed, Abaye says that we follow the taste, and since the two tastes are different, the forbidden one is nullified if there is 60 times more of permitted one. Rava still considers the name, and since both are called vinegar, any amount of forbidden vinegar makes the mixture forbidden. <br/> <br/> Art: Edward Ladell - A Still Life of Black Grapes, a Peach, a Plum, Hazelnuts, a Metal Casket and a Wine Glass on a Carved Wooden Ledge</body></html>
