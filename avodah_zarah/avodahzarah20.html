Rabbi Eliezer says, "For pay, it is permissible." <br/> <br/> Some delete the opinion of Rabbi Eliezer as an error of the scribe. Some say that although he transgressed, the pay is permissible. Yet some say that since ornaments are not a part of the idol, one may craft them for a fee. <br/> <br/> We do not sell plants attached to the ground to idol worshippers, as part of the general prohibition not to sell them land in Israel, however, one may sell the plants once they have been cut down. Rabbi Yehudah allows the sale of standing plants on the condition that the buyer will cut them down. <br/> <br/> Art: Andries Vermeulen - Still Life of a Jewellery Casket, Books and Oysters <br/></body></html>
