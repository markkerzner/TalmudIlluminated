Kahana was once late to Rav's lecture. He heard that Rav kept
mentioning the word &#8220;gourds,&#8221; and he later asked the other students,
what was Rav saying. They told him this: If one gave money to a
gardener for large gourds, while the gardener currently only had small
gourds, such a forward contract is allowed, because small gourds will
grow into large ones &#8211; provided that the gardener supplies these same
gourds.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">One
who makes a loan to his fellow may not dwell in a borrower's house for
free, nor may he rent it from him for less than the usual price &#8211;
because this constitutes interest.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a90922/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></span></div></body></html>
