a case of a two-story house, the owner living on the ground floor, and
a tenant in the upper story, if part of the floor of the upper
apartment fell in &#8211; and the owner does not want to repair it &#8211; the
occupant of the upper apartment may go down and live in the landlord's
apartment below, until the landlord repairs the upper apartment for him.<br><br>What
are the circumstances? If the landlord rented &#8220;this upper apartment,&#8221;
he would have no further obligation. If he rented &#8220;an upper apartment,&#8221;
he could provide another upper apartment. Our ruling is applicable when
the landlord said &#8220;I am renting you this upper apartment which is on
top of this lower apartment.&#8221; With these words he pledged the lower
apartment to support the tenancy of the upper story.</span></span></body></html>
