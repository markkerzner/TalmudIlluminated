litigants came before the court holding on to a cloak. One says "I
found it first," and the other one says "I found it first." One says,
"It is mine," and the other one says, "It is mine." One must swear that
he owns no less than half of it, and other one must swear that he owns
no less that half of it, and they then divide it - if possible, or sell
it and divide the money.</div><div><br></div><div>Why claim "It is mine?" It's another case, where they both gave money to the storekeeper, and now argue whose is the article.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87098/go">Test yourself</a></div></body></html>
