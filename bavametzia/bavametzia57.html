asked: &#8220;If someone planted wheat seeds in the ground and sold them
before they took root, are they subject to price fraud?&#8221; Are they
viewed as if thrown into a container, thus subject to price fraud, or
are they treated as land, not subject to price fraud? This remains
unresolved.</div><div><br></div><div>How do we know that an unpaid custodian doesn't swear about <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/06/bava-metzia-56-things-not-subject-to.html">these things</a>? &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-7.htm">If a man gives his fellow</a>...&#8221; is a generalization, &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-7.htm">money or utensils</a>...&#8221; is a specification, &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-7.htm">to watch</a>...&#8221;
is another generalization &#8211; and the overall law can include only things
that are similar to the specification, like movables with intrinsic
value, but not land or documents.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a90577/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
