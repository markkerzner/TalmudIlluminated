one finds a loan document that is certified in court, he should return
it to the creditor. Usually it is the creditor who certifies the note.
If the borrower had repaid the money, he should have ripped the
document right there, and if he didn't do so, he brought undue loss on
himself.</div><div><br></div><div>According to the letter of the law,
the land, once repossessed, need not be returned to the debtor when he
wants to repay his loan. And it is only because of &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/6-18.htm">You shall do that which is fair and good in the eyes of God</a>&#8221; &nbsp;that the Sages said that the land must be returned.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87903/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
