craftsmen are considered paid guardians. Therefore, they are liable for
loss or damage due to their negligence, or even not due to their
negligence, provided that it was not unavoidable, such as theft. </span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Once
the craftsman says to the one who hired him, "Take your property and
bring the money that is due to me," he is considered unpaid guardian,
liable only for loss or damage due to negligence.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">One
who lends money to another against a security is considered a paid
guardian in regard to the security. The lender is permitted to rent the
poor man&#8217;s security to others in order to reduce the debt, because he
is as one returning lost property to its owner.</span></div></body></html>
