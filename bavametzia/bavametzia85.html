Tarfon used to take oaths, &#8220;May I bury my sons...&#8221; if something was not
true. After his death, Rebbi traveled to his locale and asked if he had
any sons left. They told Rebbi that the son of Rabbi Tarfon's daughter
was alive, and that every harlot whose own price was two coins would
hire him for eight. Rebbi said to him, &#8220;If you repent, I will give you
my daughter in marriage.&#8221; He repented but did not marry her, so that
people would not say that he repented just because of her.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Why
did Rebbi go to such length to teach children of his friends? The one
who teaches his fellow's son Torah merits to learn in the Heavenly
Academy, and the one who teaches the son of an ignoramus can cancel
decrees that God makes.</span></div></body></html>
