but they cannot even be acquired through exchange. Thus Rav Pappa, when
he wanted to transfer the ownership of 12,000 golden coins to his
agent, used a method of acquisition &#8220;by dint of land,&#8221; where he
transferred the money together with a piece of land. Incidentally, he
needed the agent to be the owner so that the people who owed him the
sum would not hesitate to give the money to his agent.</div><div><br></div><div>Since
the coin&#8217;s value can be revoked by the government, its value is not
intrinsic, like that of a promissory note, and such items cannot be
acquired through &#8220;exchange.&#8221;</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a89847/go">Test  your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
