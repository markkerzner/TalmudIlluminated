one sells a field to his fellow and it is discovered that the field was
not his to sell &#8211; that the seller had stolen the field &#8211; and the
rightful owner repossesses the field, the defrauded seller has the
right to compensation for his money by suing the seller.<br><br>However
he has no right for the value of the improvement to the land, such as a
crop or a house. Since the field was never his, the purchase money is
considered a loan. The payment for improvement looks like interest
which is forbidden &#8211; says Shmuel. The accepted ruling is that the
purchaser has the right to improvements.<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87857/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
