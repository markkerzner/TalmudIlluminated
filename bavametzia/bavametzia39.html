someone is held captive, can a court allow a relative to live on and
use his property? If a rumor circulated or one witness testified that
the captive died, then the court can. The relative stands to inherit,
so he will be careful with the property. What if his whereabouts are
unknown?</div><div><br></div><div>Can the law be derived from &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-24.htm">and I shall become incensed and I shall kill you...and your children will be orphans</a>&#8221;?
If a person is killed, of course his children are orphans! Rather, it
must mean AS IF orphans, not using the land? No! - It could mean not
inheriting.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a89461/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
