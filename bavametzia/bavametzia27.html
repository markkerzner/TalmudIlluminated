garment is already included in &#8220;any lost article,&#8221; so what does it
teach? - Just as garment is special in that it has identifying marks
and claimants (owners), so too, anything that has identifying marks
must be announced. However, one is not obligated to return a lost
object that the owner has despaired of recovering.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Do
we see from this ruling that identifying marks are from the Torah? No.
The ruling may be mostly interested in the second part, owner's
despair, and mention the marks only incidentally.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a88690/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
