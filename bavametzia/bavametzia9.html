someone was riding on an animal and he sighted a find, an ownerless
article, and he said to his fellow, who was standing nearby, &#8220;Give it
to me,&#8221; and that other person took it and then said &#8220;I have acquired it
for myself,&#8221; - he has indeed acquired it for himself. It is implied
that he had it in mind when he picked it up, not that he changed his
mind later.</div><div><br></div><div>If, however, after he had given it
to the rider, he said &#8220;I acquired it first,&#8221; he has said nothing, that
is, his claim is dismissed and the rider may keep it.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87479/go">Test your knoweldge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
