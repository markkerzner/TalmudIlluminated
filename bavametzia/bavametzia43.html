one deposits money with a moneychanger, if the money is tied up in a
bundle, the moneychanger may not use it. Therefore, if it is lost, he
is not liable to compensate the owner. If, however, the money is loose,
he may use it. Therefore, if it is lost, he is liable.</div><div><br></div><div>When
one deposits money with a private householder, the householder may not
use it. Therefore, if it is lost, he is not liable. A storekeeper is
treated like a moneychanger.</div><div><br></div><div>If a custodian
misappropriated a deposit and later destroyed it, then according to
Beit Hillel, he pays its value at the time and in the state when he
used it.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a89675/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
