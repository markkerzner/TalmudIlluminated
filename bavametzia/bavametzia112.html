an employer delays payment for contractual work, where a craftsman
agreed to complete a specific task for a fixed sum of money, does he
transgress the prohibition not to hold wages overnight?<br><br>This
depends on how one views the improvement to the utensil that the
craftsman makes. If the craftsman acquires the improvements, he in
effect sells the owner that portion when he returns the finished
product, and the money that the owner owes is not considered wages but
a loan.<br><br>The prevailing view, however, is that the craftsman does
not acquire the improvements and that the payments owed to him are thus
wages, hence the prohibition against delaying payments applies to
contractual work.</span></body></html>
