a creditor tells to his debtor, &#8220;You owe me a maneh (100 zuz, $5000),
and the debtor says, &#8220;I owe you nothing because I never borrowed,&#8221; and
witnesses testify against the debtor that he did borrow, and
subsequently the debtor said, &#8220;I paid this debt&#8221; - he is presumed a
liar in reference to that money, and&nbsp;without providing witnesses&nbsp;he is
not believed that he repaid.</div><div><br></div><div>A monetary
obligation imposed by the court, such as Ketubah, has the strength of a
document, and without witnesses one is not believed to claim that he
repaid it.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87989/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
