man must be especially careful not to offend his wife with his words -
or any other woman - because with her tears she may bring retribution
on him. One must also be very careful about his wife&#8217;s honor, because a
person&#8217;s house is blessed only on account of his wife.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi
Eliezer and the Sages argued about the purity of sectional ovens. Rabbi
Eliezer performed multiple miracles, but it was no proof. Heavenly
voice said that he was right &#8211; but the Torah is not in Heaven, but
rather decided by knowledgeable men. The Sages then rightfully
excommunicated him. Still, since he was upset, a third of the world&#8217;s
crops rotted and Rabban Gamliel died.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a90649/go"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Test your knowledge of the daf</span></a></div></body></html>
