The law in any particular case depends on two factors: the amount of
the fraud, and the period of time that elapses between the transaction
and the time the defrauded party protests.<div><br></div><div>If the
amount of price fraud is the discrepancy of less than 1/6, the sale
stands and all claims are immediately waived. If the amount is exactly
1/6, the buyer can demand a refund. If the amount is more than one
sixth, either party can void the sale.</div><div><br></div><div>The defrauded party has as much time as it takes to show the purchase to a merchant or to his relative for assessment.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a90084/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
