one found bills of divorce, or bills of emancipation of slaves, or
sickbed wills, or gift documents, or receipts &#8211; he should not return
them to the recipients named on them. It is possible that they were
written with the intent to give them, but the author reconsidered and
decided not to give them, and it was he who lost them. The above
documents effect the transaction, thus, if the writer lost them, they
don't take effect.</div><div><br></div><div>Wills are generally not
effective in Torah law; unless formal gift has been made before death,
property passes automatically to the rightful heirs defined by the
Torah. Sickbed will is an exception.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a88071/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
