one saw people running after a find, after a lame deer, or after young
pigeons that cannot yet fly, and said, &#8220;My field has acquired it for
me,&#8221; - it has indeed acquired it for him. If the deer was running
normally, or if the pigeons were flying, and he said, &#8220;My field has
acquired it for me,&#8221; - he has said nothing.</div><div><br></div><div>This
method of acquisition is called &#8220;courtyard.&#8221; &nbsp;The owner doesn't have to
declare his intention &#8211; it is only stated to emphasize the second case
in the ruling. He does have to stand next to his field, making it
comparable to a courtyard.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87607/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
