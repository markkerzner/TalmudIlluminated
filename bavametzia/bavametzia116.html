two people lived in a two-story house, such as two brothers who
inherited their father's house, one taking the ground floor and the
other the upper story, and the building collapsed, how do we allocate
the debris? They divide the wood, the stones, and the earth (used as
cement) in proportion to the heights of their respective properties.<br><br>To
allocate the whole and the broken stones, we determine how each wall
collapsed. If it collapsed directly downwards, presumably the lower
stones broke, and the rest of the wall fell upon them, so the whole
stones are allotted to the owner of the upper story. If the wall was
knocked over to the side, presumably the upper stones broke, and the
owner of the ground floor gets the whole ones.</span></body></html>
