shall not see the ox of your brother or his sheep wandering and hide
from them, rather, you shall return them to your brother</a>&#8221; the words
&#8220;...and hide from them...&#8221; can be understood to mean that sometimes you
do hide from them. For example, an elderly person is not required to
pick up an object that is beneath his dignity.<br><br>Concerning the areas in which Moses should instruct the Jews, the words &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/18-20.htm">that they shall do</a>...&#8221;
refer to maintaining a standard of conduct that goes beyond the letter
of the law. Said Rabbi Yochanan: &#8220;Jerusalem was destroyed only because
Jews didn't go beyond the letter of the law.&#8221;<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a88835/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
