a thief told two people, &#8220;I stole one maneh ($5,000) from one of you,
but I don't know from which of you I stole it,&#8221; - or if a custodian
told two people, &#8220;The father of one of you deposited a maneh with me,
but I don't know which one he was&#8221; - he gives each one a maneh, because
he acknowledged the claim himself.</div><div><br></div><div>Both cases
describe going beyond the letter of the law. The thief wants to avoid
Heavenly retribution, and the custodian feels at fault for not keeping
the records.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a89333/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
