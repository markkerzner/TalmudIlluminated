Yochanan, who was extremely beautiful, was swimming in the river. Resh
Lakish, at this time a highway man, mistook him for a woman, and jumped
after. Rabbi Yochanan told Resh Lakish that he had a sister even more
beautiful than him, and if Resh Lakish decided to study Torah, he could
marry her.<br><br>Resh Lakish became a great scholar. Once they were
discussing when weapons are considered finished and therefore
susceptible to ritual impurity. Rabbi Yochanan said, &#8220;when they are
harderened,&#8221; but Resh Lakish said &#8220;when they are polished.&#8221; Rabbi
Yochanan said, &#8220;Robber knows his trade&#8221; - as a praise, but Resh Lakish
misunderstood and said, &#8220;And what have you given me? I was called
Teacher among robbers also.&#8221; Rabbi Yochanan was displeased, and Resh
Lakish died. Rabbi Yochanan was inconsolable on the loss of his student
and his mind became disturbed. The Sages asked for mercy on him, and he
departed.</span></body></html>
