they should be returned to the last renter, but here we are dealing
with a case of three people renting together. If one of them lost coins
and can't find them, he despairs of getting them back. He thinks of the
other two: &#8220;They probably took the coins and intend to keep them. But
if I confront one, he can tell me that it was the other, and I can't
make him to take an oath.&#8221; Thus the finder can keep them.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://mystudiyo.com/ch/a88650/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></div></body></html>
