an object without an identifying mark is lost, the owner despairs of
recovering it, because he knows that even if it is found, he will be
unable to prove that it is his. Therefore the following objects belong
to the finder: scattered produce, scattered coins, small sheaves in a
public domain, round cakes of pressed figs, baker's loaves.<br><br>When
someone loses such an object but before he discovers his loss - Rava
says that the object is already abandoned, but Abbaye disagrees. The
law in this case follows Abbaye: until the owner has consciously
despaired of recovering the lost object, the finder is not permitted to
keep it.<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a88325/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
