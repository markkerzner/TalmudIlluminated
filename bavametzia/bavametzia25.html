one finds items with an identifying mark, he can presume that the owner
has not despaired of recovering them, hence he has to announce the find
and return it to owner. Examples include produce in a vessel, or a
vessel as is, homemade loaves of bread, jugs of wine, and jugs of oil &#8211;
these used to have individual seals.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If one
found behind a wall &#8211; which provides partial protection - young pigeons
that were tied, he should not touch them. Perhaps a person put them
there, and if the finder takes them and announces them, the owner may
not have signs to claim them.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a88588/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
