From: &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/22-2.htm">and it (the lost object) will remain with you <span style="font-weight: bold;">until</span> your brother seeks it out</a>...&#8221;. Since you can't return it <span style="font-weight: bold;">before</span>
he asks (seeks) for it, the word &#8220;seek&#8221; must mean something else &#8211; that
you must seek out whether he is a liar or not by the use of identifying
marks.<br><br>Thus a lost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_%28divorce_document%29">Get</a> can be returned if the owner names a sign, such as a hole next to a specific letter.<br><br>During
the time of the Temple, the finder would announce his find three times,
on Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot, but now it is announced in the
neighborhood.<br><br><a href="http://mystudiyo.com/ch/a88742/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
