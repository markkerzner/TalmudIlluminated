a tenant-farmer leased a field from his fellow and locusts ate up the
crop or it was blasted by wind, which blew the kernels out of the ears
of grain, if it is a general calamity, he may deduct from his rental.
Since the whole area was stricken, his field is considered unfit for
crops, and the tenant committed himself to pay full rental only on the
assumption that the field would remain suitable for crops for the
duration of the lease.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">If
the loss was localized, the owner can claim that it was the farmer's
ill fortune, and the farmer may not deduct from his rental.</span></div></body></html>
