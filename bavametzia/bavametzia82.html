a porter carries someone&#8217;s keg from one place to another, he has the
legal responsibility of a custodian. If he accidentally slips and
breaks the keg, then Rabbi Meir says that whether he is paid or not, he
can swear and free himself from liability.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi
Yehudah says that slipping is negligence. Therefore, a paid porter is
liable for it, as any paid custodian, but an unpaid porter is not.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">And
Rabbi Meir? He agrees that stumbling is considered negligence, but
since people are usually not careful about it, the Rabbis made a decree
that a porter can be absolved through an oath, because otherwise nobody
will move a keg of his fellow. He swears that he did not break it
deliberately.</span></div></body></html>
