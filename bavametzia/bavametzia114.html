Bar Avuha found Elijah the prophet standing in a cemetery of idolaters
and asked him, &#8220;Why is master who is a Kohen standing in a cemetery?&#8221;<br><br>Elijah answered, &#8220;Did you not learn the Order  of Purities?&#8221;  For Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai said, based on &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/ezekiel/34-31.htm">Now you my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are you called man</a>...&#8221; - about whom it is said, &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/19-14.htm">when a man dies in a tent</a>...&#8221; and therefore only Jewish graves are impure for a Kohen.<br><br>He
said to Elijah, &#8220;I am not able to properly study the four most
important orders, am I to study the sixth (Purities)? &#8211; for I am very
poor.&#8221;<br><br>Elijah brought him up to the Garden of Eden and told him
to collect some leaves. Rabbah understood that he was spending his
reward in the World To Come and threw the leaves away. Still, his cloak
absorbed the smell, and he sold it for 12,000 golden dinars &#8211; and
distributed them to his sons-in-law.</span></body></html>
