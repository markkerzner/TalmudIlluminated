who finds a lost object is not required to bear the expense of
maintaining it until the owner reclaims it. For example, a rooster or
calf need to be fed but can not do anything to earn their keep. They
should be sold, and the money held for the owner. If an animal works
and eats, such as an ox or donkey, it should be put to work for twelve
months, then sold. One may use that money, so if it is lost, he is
responsible.<br><br>If one found books (scrolls), he should read from them once in thirty days, to air them out and prevent their decay.<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a88786/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
