immediate neighbor of a property has the right of first purchase to it.
An outsider who wants to buy a field can easily find another one, but a
neighbor gains significantly from being able to buy an adjoining field.
This rule is based on &#8220;</span><a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/6-18.htm"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">You shall do what is right and good in the eyes of God</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">&#8230;&#8221;  which commands one to go beyond the letter of the law.</span><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">If one wants to buy a field and inquires of the neighbor of that field if he can do it, and the neighbor allows it,  a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/06/bava-metzia-45-coins-used-for-symbolic.html">formal act of acquisition</a>
is still required, or else the neighbor can later claim that had he
come to buy the land, he would be asked a higher price, but that he
never meant to relinquish his right.</span></body></html>
