makes a stipulation contrary to what is written in the Torah, his
stipulation is void. Any stipulation after the action is void. For
example, &#8220;This item is yours on condition that you walk a mile&#8221; - the
items is his and he does not have to walk. Any stipulation that is
impossible to fulfill is void. For example, &#8220;This is your Get on
condition that you cross the sea on foot&#8221; - the condition is void, the
Get is valid, and the woman is divorced.<br><br>If one borrows a cow but hires the owner along with it, <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-15.htm">he is not liable if the cow dies.</a></span></body></html>
