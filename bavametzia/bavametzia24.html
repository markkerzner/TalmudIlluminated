Yehudah was following behind the master, Shmuel, in the market of
cereal stores. He asked Shmuel, &#8220;If one found a purse here, what is the
law?&#8221; Shmuel said, &#8220;It belongs to the finder.&#8221; Many people pass by
here, and one of them is likely to take it. Thus, the owner despairs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Rav
Yehudah continued, &#8220;If a Jew comes and gives an identifying mark for
it, what is the law?&#8221; Shmuel said, &#8220;He is obligated to return it.&#8221; How
can both rulings be true? The second statement reflects a moral
obligation of going beyond the letter of the law.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a88516/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
