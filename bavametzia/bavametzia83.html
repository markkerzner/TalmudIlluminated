bar bar Chanan hired porters to carry a keg of wine, and they broke it
through negligence, such as stumbling on level ground. Rabbah bar bar
Chanan took their cloaks as payment.<br><br>The porters went to the
court of Rav and told him about it. Rav said to Rabbah bar bar Chanan,
&#8220;Give them back their cloaks.&#8221; &#8220;Is that the law?&#8221; - he asked. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; -
said Rav, quoting from Proverbs, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/2-20.htm">In order that you go on the path of good people</a>...&#8221;<br><br>They
said to Rav, &#8220;We are poor people, and we labored the entire day; we are
starving and have nothing to eat.&#8221; Rav said to Rabbah bar bar Chanan,
&#8220;Pay them their fee.&#8221; &#8220;Is that the law?&#8221; - he asked. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; - said Rav,
quoting the end of the phrase, &#8220;...and keep the ways of the righteous.&#8221;</span></body></html>
