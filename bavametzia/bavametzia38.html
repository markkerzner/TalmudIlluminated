reason is that a person prefers a measure of his own produce - for
which he toiled - to nine measures of his fellow's produce which can be
bought. That is an exaggeration, but if it is not spoiling faster than
normal, it should not be sold. </div><div><br></div><div>Another
explanation is that he may have designated it as tithes for his other
produce, and he may come to eat non-tithed produce. Knowing that the
produce is not sold, the owner is even more likely to do this
designation.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a89411/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
