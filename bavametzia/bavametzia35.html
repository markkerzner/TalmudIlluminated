one deposits with another an animal or utensils for safekeeping and
they were stolen or lost, the custodian can take an oath that he was
not negligent, and free himself from payment. If he did not desire to
swear and paid, and then the thief is found, the thief pays the double
payment to the custodian.<br><br>If one rented a cow and then lent it
to another, and it subsequently died a natural death, then the renter
is not liable for that, but the borrower is liable to pay to the
renter. Rabbi Yossi says that the renter needs to return the value of
the cow to the owner.<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a89241/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
