someone saw a find, an ownersless article, and fell upon it &nbsp;- and
another came and seized it, the one who seized it has acquired it.
Formal methods of acquisition, or coming into legal possession of a
movable object, include lifting it, but they do not include falling on
it.</div><div><br></div><div>Later, Rabbis instituted another method of
acquisition, where four cubits (about 6 feet) would acquire ownerless
objects for the person, so that people would not come to quarrel with
one another. Then why in the case above he didn't acquire through the
four cubits rule? Because it works only in the public area, but he was
in someone's field.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://mystudiyo.com/ch/a87534/go/play">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></div></body></html>
