a tenant-farmer leased a field from his fellow but did not want to weed
it and said to the landowner, &#8220;What concern is it of yours, since I am
committed to giving you your full rental?&#8221; - we do not listen to him,
for the landowner can reply, &#8220;If you lease expired and you don't renew
it, the field will grow weeds for me.&#8221;</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">If
a sharecropper leased a field from his fellow and it did not produce a
substantial crop, so that he wants to abandon working the field, if
there is enough growing in it to produce a heap, he is obligated to
care for it. Rabbi Yehudah says, &#8220;What kind of limit is a heap? Rather
if there is enough for sowing the field again.&#8221;</span></div></body></html>
