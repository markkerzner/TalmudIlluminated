man was selling silk ribbons, asking six zuz, although they were
actually worth five, and it was apparent that he would take
five-and-a-half. Another man came along and said to himself, &#8220;If I give
him five-and-a-half, it will be considered an immediate waving of the
overpayment. I will instead give him six, and then summon him to
judgment for the entire overcharge of one zuz.&#8221;</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">When
he came before Rava for a ruling, Rava said to him, &#8220;The rules of
overcharging apply only to a merchant, but when buying from a
householder, the buyer has no claim of price fraud.&#8221; People consider
their personal effects dear and sell them for more than their worth.</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;"><br></span></div><div><a href="http://mystudiyo.com/ch/a90192/go/play"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: medium;">Test your knowledge of the daf</span></a></div></body></html>
