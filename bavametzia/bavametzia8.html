one lifts up an object that he found, intending to acquire it entirely
for his fellow, then his fellow acquires it. This is true even though
he thereby deprives other potential finders of the object. It can be
proved from <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/talmud_daily/2149.html">the case of two people who have found a garment</a>.<br><br>There
each one is holding his end of the garment, and should his fellow drop
it, the garment would partially rest on the floor, which would mean
that our claimant has not acquired it either, since complete lifting is
required. We must conclude that when they lift the garment, both intend
to help the other one acquire it.<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87413/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
