it be the hire of a man, the hire of an animal, or the hire of a
utensil &#8211; that is, the wages due a man for his labor, or the payment
due him for renting his animals or utensils, one is subject to <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/08/bava-metzia-110-timely-payment-of-hired.html">both prohibitions against delaying a payment</a>.<br><br>When
is this so? When the worker demanded his wage from the employer. But if
the worker did not demand his wages from the employer, the employer
does not transgress the law. If the employer directed him to a
storekeeper or a moneychanger (by arranging an account with them) but
the worker was not paid, the employer does not transgress the law.</span></body></html>
