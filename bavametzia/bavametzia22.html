and gave to the other, the recipient may keep the goods. Similarly, if
a robber, who robs openly, took from one and gave to the other, again
the recipient may keep it.<br><br>The case of a robber is

recipient thus acquires them. But in the case of a thief the owner is
not aware of his loss! It must be that the despair which will come
later is already effective, just like<a href="http://community.livejournal.com/talmud_daily/7057.html"> Rava and not Abbaye</a>? No!
