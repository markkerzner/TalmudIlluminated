Reuven sold a field to Shimon with a guarantee (Reuven agreed to refund
Shimon's money in the event the field is collected by Reuven's
creditors), and Reuven's creditor comes and attempts to collect the
field from Shimon in payment of Reuven's obligation, the law is that
Reuven may go and argue the case with the creditor to prevent him to
collect the field. And the creditor may not tell Reuven, &#8220;You have not
standing in the matter.&#8221;<br><br>But otherwise, anyone who has no
standing cannot argue the case in court, and attorney representation is
disallowed, and so decides Shulchan Aruch. Other opinions, however,
allow power of attorney.<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87826/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
