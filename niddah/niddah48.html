This changes some marital laws for them, thus, if a female is twenty but has not sprouted two pubic hairs, she must bring a proof of her age, and will then be considered as forever immature ("aylonit"): <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum"><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum">yibum</a></a> Â (levirate marriage) cannot be done to her, and she does not require <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halizah"><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halizah">halitzah</a></a> and can marry anyone if her husband dies. Similarly, a man who is twenty but has not sprouted two pubic hairs, must bring a proof of his age, and he then need not perform <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum"><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum">yibum</a></a> or be the subject of <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halizah"><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halizah">halitzah</a></a> . <br/> <br/> The lower sign (two pubic hairs) always comes before the upper sign (breast development). When the lower sign is present, the girl can do either <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halizah"><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halizah">halitzah</a></a> or <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum"><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum">yibum</a></a>, and when the upper sign ( <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-47-metaphor-of-fig.html">small fig stage of development</a> ) is present, we can presume the same - these are the words of the Sages. However, Rabbi Meir disagrees on two counts. If the upper sign is present, according to Rabbi Meir it means nothing, so she cannot <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halizah"><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halizah">halitzah</a></a>, which only adults can do. And although minor can do <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum"><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum">yibum</a></a>, Rabbi Meir does not allow it for a different reason: a minority of people never mature, and Rabbi Meir, who always takes a statistical minority into account, is apprehensive that the girl or a boy will never mature, and their <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum"><a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yibbum">yibum</a></a> would retroactively violate a serious prohibition, so according to Rabbi Meir they must wait till they fully mature. <br/> <br/> When an examination of a girl was required, it was done by a woman. <br/> <br/> Art: Rembrandt Van Rijn - A youth in a cap and gorget</body></html>
