But - the Talmud asks - all dead bodies convey spiritual impurity through carrying!? - Well, here we are dealing with a case where a corpse lay on a massive, immobile stone. Since this stone is very heavy, then an object below the stone it does not really "carry" the corpse on top of it, and thus this object does not become ritually impure because of the corpse. However, if this corpse belongs to a <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-68-when-to-examine-oneself.html">zav</a>, then the object under the stone does become ritually impure. <br/> <br/> In truth, the corpse of a <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-68-when-to-examine-oneself.html">zav</a> does not transmit ritual impurity either. It is the Sages, who decreed that it does, because this may be confused with a live <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-68-when-to-examine-oneself.html">zav</a>, lying on the top of the stone. The concern was that if a dead <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-68-when-to-examine-oneself.html">zav</a> does not carry ritual impurity, then people may confuse him with a live <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-68-when-to-examine-oneself.html">zav</a> who fainted, who does carry impurity. To prevent this confusion, the Sages decrees that a dead <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/07/niddah-68-when-to-examine-oneself.html">zav</a> should have the same impurity as the live one would. <br/> <br/> Art: Theodore Gericault - Head of a Dead Young Man</body></html>
