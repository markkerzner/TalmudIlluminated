First the outer foreskin is removed, and then the membrane is pulled back. Then one who performs the circumcision draws the blood - for otherwise the accumulated blood would cause danger - and afterward the dresses up the wound.
<br />
<br />
All of the these operations are required for proper circumcision and are permitted on Shabbat. If one did not prepare an ointment, he may do so - albeit in an unusual manner. If he did not prepare a bandage in the right shape, he may not do so now - but he can wrap a cloth around the wound. If he did not bring the cloth before Shabbat, he may even bring it on Shabbat - but only through courtyards, not through the streets where carrying is forbidden.
