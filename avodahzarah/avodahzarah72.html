<br />
Those who consider a stream connecting two vessels as an actual connection, transmitting the prohibition, explain that the bottom of the idolater's flask contained minute amounts of libation wine. Through the stream connection, the wine in the funnel also become prohibited, and through it - the next wine that was poured. Those who say that the stream is not a significant connection, explain that the funnel was touching the wine on the bottom.<br />
<br />
If an idolater pours wine from a bottle into a cup, the wine in the cup is prohibited, but the wine remaining in the bottle is permitted.<br />
