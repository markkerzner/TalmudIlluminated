It is implied that he had it in mind when he picked it up, not that he changed his mind later. <br/> If, however, after he had given it to the rider, he said "I acquired it first," he has said nothing, that is, his claim is dismissed and the rider may keep it. <br/> <a href = "http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87479/go">Test your knoweldge of the daf</a></body></html>
