It is as if God said, "I knew who was first-born in Egypt, and I will know those who falsely attribute their money to a non-Jew, and then lend it on interest." <br/> <br/> Neshech , or fixed interested prearranged at the time of the agreement, is prohibited by the Torah and can be collected in court. But Rabbi Yochanan says that " <a href = "http://scripturetext.com/leviticus/25-36.htm">You shall not take from him (your impoverished brother) interest or increase; but fear your God</a> ," implies that he who takes interest is obligated to refund the interest out fear of God, but he is not subject to refund it by a court order. <br/> <br/></body></html>
