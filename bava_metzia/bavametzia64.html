He heard that Rav kept mentioning the word "gourds," and he later asked the other students, what was Rav saying. They told him this: If one gave money to a gardener for large gourds, while the gardener currently only had small gourds, such a forward contract is allowed, because small gourds will grow into large ones - provided that the gardener supplies these same gourds. <br/> One who makes a loan to his fellow may not dwell in a borrower's house for free, nor may he rent it from him for less than the usual price - because this constitutes interest. <br/> <br/></body></html>
