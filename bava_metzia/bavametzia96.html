Since it says, "… <a href = "http://bible.cc/exodus/22-14.htm">if its owner is not with him, he shall surely pay</a> ", the owner being with him at one point of time is sufficient, but which point in time? <br/> Is it at the time of the borrowing when the cow comes under his control, or at the time of the accident, when he becomes obligated? - It is the time of borrowing, because then he becomes responsible for its sustenance. <br/> And "with him" means either works for him or serves him. <br/></body></html>
