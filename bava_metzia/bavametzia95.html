It is silent, however, about theft and loss, which are avoidable mishaps. <br/> <br/> We can derive it ourselves with an <a href = "null">a fortiori argument</a> : if a paid custodian, who is exempted from liability when the animal suffers a broken limb or dies, is nonetheless liable in cases of theft and loss, is it not logical that a borrower, who is indeed liable in cases of the animal suffering a broken limb or dying, is also liable in cases of theft and loss? Surely this is so.</body></html>
