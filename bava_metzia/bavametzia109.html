Planting flax would lead him to return the land in worse condition than he received it. <br/> This ruling applies only to a tenant-farmer, where the landowner receives a fixed payment no matter what the land produces. In the case of a sharecropper, we assume that the landowner agrees to a more intensive use of the land based on the principle "let the land become poor but not the owner".</body></html>
