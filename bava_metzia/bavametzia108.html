An outsider who wants to buy a field can easily find another one, but a neighbor gains significantly from being able to buy an adjoining field. This rule is based on " <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/6-18.htm">You shall do what is right and good in the eyes of God</a> â€¦" which commands one to go beyond the letter of the law. <br/> If one wants to buy a field and inquires of the neighbor of that field if he can do it, and the neighbor allows it, a <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/06/bava-metzia-45-coins-used-for-symbolic.html">formal act of acquisition</a> is still required, or else the neighbor can later claim that had he come to buy the land, he would be asked a higher price, but that he never meant to relinquish his right.</body></html>
