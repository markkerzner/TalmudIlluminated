And the creditor may not tell Reuven, "You have not standing in the matter." <br/> <br/> But otherwise, anyone who has no standing cannot argue the case in court, and attorney representation is disallowed, and so decides Shulchan Aruch. Other opinions, however, allow power of attorney. <br/> <br/> <a href = "http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87826/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
