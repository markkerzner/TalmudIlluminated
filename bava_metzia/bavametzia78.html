If the animal died of heat, he is liable, since the valley is a warm place surrounded by cool mountains. <br/> If the donkey was temporarily put into king's services, the renter waits for its return, but if it dies, the owner provides another donkey. <br/> <a href = "http://mystudiyo.com/act91644/go/">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
