Therefore the following objects belong to the finder: scattered produce, scattered coins, small sheaves in a public domain, round cakes of pressed figs, baker's loaves. <br/> <br/> When someone loses such an object but before he discovers his loss - Rava says that the object is already abandoned, but <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin27.html">A</a>baye disagrees. The law in this case follows Abaye: until the owner has consciously despaired of recovering the lost object, the finder is not permitted to keep it. <br/> <br/> This is the "<a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-metzia/bava-metzia21.html">Y</a>" in the six cases abbreviated Y A <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/eruvin/eruvin15.html">L</a> <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/kiddushin/kiddushin51.html">K</a> G <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin27.html">M</a> where the law follows Abaye against Rava. <br/></body></html>
