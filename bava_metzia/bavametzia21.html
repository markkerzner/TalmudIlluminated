Therefore the following objects belong to the finder: scattered produce, scattered coins, small sheaves in a public domain, round cakes of pressed figs, baker's loaves. <br/> <br/> When someone loses such an object but before he discovers his loss - Rava says that the object is already abandoned, but <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">A</a>baye disagrees. The law in this case follows <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">A</a>baye: until the owner has consciously despaired of recovering the lost object, the finder is not permitted to keep it. <br/> <br/> This is the "<a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/05/bava-metzia-21-lost-objects-that-finder.html">Y</a>" in the six cases abbreviated <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/05/bava-metzia-21-lost-objects-that-finder.html">Y</a> <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">A</a> <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/04/eruvin-15-abaye-wins.html">L</a> <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/11/kiddushin-51-should-betrothal-allow.html">K</a> G <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">M</a> where the law follows <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">A</a>baye against Rava. <br/></body></html>
