Therefore, if it is lost, he is not liable to compensate the owner. If, however, the money is loose, he may use it. Therefore, if it is lost, he is liable. <br/> When one deposits money with a private householder, the householder may not use it. Therefore, if it is lost, he is not liable. A storekeeper is treated like a moneychanger. <br/> If a custodian misappropriated a deposit and later destroyed it, then according to Beit Hillel, he pays its value at the time and in the state when he used it. <br/> <a href = "http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a89675/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
