The law in any particular case depends on two factors: the amount of the fraud, and the period of time that elapses between the transaction and the time the defrauded party protests. <br/> <br/> <br/> If the amount of price fraud is the discrepancy of less than 1/6, the sale stands and all claims are immediately waived. If the amount is exactly 1/6, the buyer can demand a refund. If the amount is more than one sixth, either party can void the sale. <br/> The defrauded party has as much time as it takes to show the purchase to a merchant or to his relative for assessment. <br/> <br/></body></html>
