One must also be very careful about his wife’s honor, because a person’s house is blessed only on account of his wife. <br/> Rabbi Eliezer and the Sages argued about the purity of sectional ovens. Rabbi Eliezer performed multiple miracles, but it was no proof. Heavenly voice said that he was right - but the Torah is not in Heaven, but rather decided by knowledgeable men. The Sages then rightfully excommunicated him.
