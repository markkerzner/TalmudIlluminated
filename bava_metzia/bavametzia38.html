That is an exaggeration, but if it is not spoiling faster than normal, it should not be sold. <br/> Another explanation is that he may have designated it as tithes for his other produce, and he may come to eat non-tithed produce. Knowing that the produce is not sold, the owner is even more likely to do this designation. <br/> <a href = "http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a89411/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
