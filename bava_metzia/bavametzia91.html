But why should it be so? The rule is that one does not receive lashes and pay money for the same crime! <br/> The proof is from the case of <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-kamma/bava-kamma71.html">a son consorting with his mother who is a harlot</a> . Since the son is liable to the death penalty for incest, he is not obligated to pay, and the sheep that he gave her should be considered a present, not a payment. Since the Torah forbade that sheep as a sacrifice, it must be that he is legally obligated to pay, only that it is unenforceable in court. So too in the case of muzzling.</body></html>
