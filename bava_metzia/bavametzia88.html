However, the Sages have established that a tithing obligation is fixed also when the produce is sold or when Sabbath arrives. <br/> The obligation not to stop your workers from eating at the time of harvesting is similar to the prohibition of " <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">You shall not muzzle an ox in its threshing</a> ," which applies to already harvested produce. Clearly, all animals are included, so by mentioning "ox" the Torah teaches another law: just as a worker is allowed to eat unharvested produce, so too an ox.</body></html>
