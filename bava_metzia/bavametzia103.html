A sharecropper pays the owner of the land a fixed percentage of the crops, for example, a half, third, or quarter, and keeps the rest. The tenant-farmer pays a fixed amount, usually using field’s produce, but if it’s not enough, he buys from the market. <br/> If one leases a field from his fellow and they did not agree on the ways of cultivating the field, such as cut or uproot the crop or whether to plow afterwards, they should follow the local custom. <br/> Just as they divide the wine, so they divide the branches and the canes - in the same proportion, and this applies only to sharecropping. <br/></body></html>
