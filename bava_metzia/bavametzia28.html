From: "... <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/22-2.htm">and it (the lost object) will remain with you until your brother seeks it out</a> ...". Since you can't return it before he asks (seeks) for it, the word "seek" must mean something else - that you must seek out whether he is a liar or not by the use of identifying marks. <br/> <br/> Thus a lost <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_%28divorce_document%29">Get</a> can be returned if the owner names a sign, such as a hole next to a specific letter. <br/> <br/> During the time of the Temple, the finder would announce his find three times, on Passover, Shavuot, and Sukkot, but now it is announced in the neighborhood. <br/> <br/> <a href = "http://mystudiyo.com/ch/a88742/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
