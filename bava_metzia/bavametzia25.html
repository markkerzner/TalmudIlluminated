Examples include produce in a vessel, or a vessel as is, homemade loaves of bread, jugs of wine, and jugs of oil - these used to have individual seals.Â  <br/> If one found behind a wall - which provides partial protection - young pigeons that were tied, he should not touch them. Perhaps a person put them there, and if the finder takes them and announces them, the owner may not have signs to claim them. <br/> <a href = "null">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
