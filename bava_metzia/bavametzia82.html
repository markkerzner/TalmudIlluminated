If he accidentally slips and breaks the keg, then Rabbi Meir says that whether he is paid or not, he can swear and free himself from liability. <br/> Rabbi Yehudah says that slipping is negligence. Therefore, a paid porter is liable for it, as any paid custodian, but an unpaid porter is not. <br/> And Rabbi Meir? He agrees that stumbling is considered negligence, but since people are usually not careful about it, the Rabbis made a decree that a porter can be absolved through an oath, because otherwise nobody will move a keg of his fellow. He swears that he did not break it deliberately. <br/></body></html>
