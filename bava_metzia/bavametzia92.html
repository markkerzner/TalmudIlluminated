The Torah tells the worker "... <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/23-24.htm">you may eat grapes as is your desire, to your satiety</a> ..." which implies that he may eat any amount needed to satisfy his hunger. <br/> Rabbi Elazar Chisma says that a worker may not eat more than his wage. <br/> But the Sages permit this - however, his friends should teach him not be a glutton and thereby close the door to future employment.</body></html>
