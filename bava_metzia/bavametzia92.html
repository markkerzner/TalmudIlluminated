A worker who is harvesting may eat from this harvest. What can he eat and how much?
He can eat a cucumber (cucumbers were expensive) or a date (which were also expensive) 
even if worth a dinar (six times his wage). 
The Torah tells the worker 
"...<a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=23#P5519">
 you may eat as many grapes as you desire</a> ..." which implies that he may eat any amount 
needed to satisfy his hunger. <br/><br/>
Rabbi Elazar Chisma says that a worker may not eat more than his wage, but the Sages permit this - 
however, his friends should teach him not be a glutton and thereby close the door to future employment.
