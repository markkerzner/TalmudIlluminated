One should not say to someone, "How much is this item?" if he has no intention of buying. If someone was a penitent, one should not say to him, "Remember your past deeds." If someone was descended from proselytes, one should not say to him, "Remember the idol worship of your forefathers," - for it is stated in the Torah, " <a href = "http://bible.cc/exodus/22-21.htm">And you shall not wrong or oppress a proselyte</a> ...." <br/> The commandment " <a href = "http://bible.cc/leviticus/25-17.htm">And a man shall not wrong his fellow</a> ..." is discussing verbal wronging, since monetary wronging is discussed <a href = "http://bible.cc/leviticus/25-14.htm">immediately before</a> . <br/> <a href = "http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a90602/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
