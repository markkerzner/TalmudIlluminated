It is deemed as if the lender acquires the other wheat right away, and consequently, if its value increases, it is as though the lenderâ€™s own wheat increases, and there is no question of interest. <br/> Nevertheless, Hillel prohibits it. Hillel also wanted to prohibit a woman to lend a loaf to her friend, to be repaid with another loaf, unless they assess the value at the time of the loan, but the Sages did not agree with him. <br/></body></html>
