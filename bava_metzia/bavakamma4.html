Sheshet says that the fifty <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuz_(coin)">zuz</a> are viewed as if the lender is holding them. The defendant admits nothing about them, and denies completely the other fifty, thus there is no oath, and he is not liable for anything else. <br/> <a href = "http://mystudiyo.com/ch/a87215/go/play">Test yourself</a></body></html>
