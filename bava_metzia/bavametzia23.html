The sign can be weight, bundle count, or location where it was lost.  <br/> If objects without a sign look like they have been left by the owner, the finder announces them, lest the people who don't observe this law will take them. <br/> <a href = "http://mystudiyo.com/ch/a88413/go/play">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
