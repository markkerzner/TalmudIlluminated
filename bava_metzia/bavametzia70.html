The guaranteed part of the investment is then a loan, and the profit on it is a form of interest prohibited by the Sages. <br/> However, one is allowed to invest the money of orphans where they stand to gain more than to lose, by a court appointee. <br/> One is allowed to loan on interest to a non-Jew. In fact, there is nothing wrong with charging interest, but the Torah wants all Jews to behave like members of a family.</body></html>
