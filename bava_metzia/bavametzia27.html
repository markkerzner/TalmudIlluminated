However, one is not obligated to return a lost object that the owner has despaired of recovering.Â  <br/> Do we see from this ruling that identifying marks are from the Torah? No. The ruling may be mostly interested in the second part, owner's despair, and mention the marks only incidentally. <br/> <br/></body></html>
