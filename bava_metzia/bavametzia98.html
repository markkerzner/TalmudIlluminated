The lender claims, "It died while being borrowed," making the borrower liable, but the borrower says "I don't know" - the borrower is liable. <br/> Can we disprove from here the following ruling of Rav Nachman? If one claims to another, "you owe me a maneh (100 zuz)" and the other one says, "I don't know if I owe you" - the defendant is NOT liable. But in the first ruling he is! <br/> Rav Nachman will answer that the first ruling is talking about two cows, and about one of them the borrower agrees to his liability. This makes it a case of <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/04/bava-metzia-3.html">borrower admitting in part</a> , so that he has to swear, but not knowing about the second claim, he can't swear and thus has to pay. <br/></body></html>
