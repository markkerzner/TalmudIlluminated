Likely, the borrower would like to repay, but doesn't have the complete amount, so he admits to a part, thinking to repay the rest later. Thus the Torah imposed an oath to force him to tell the truth. <br/> <br/> Likewise, if witnesses testified that the borrower owes part of the loan, he has to take an oath for the rest. <br/> <br/> <a href = "http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a87186/go">Test yourself</a></body></html>
