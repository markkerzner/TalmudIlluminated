They receive hourly wages for the time they have already worked. <br/> Contractors hired to perform a specific task can also quit at any time. However, if the employer has to hire other workers at a higher rate in order to complete the task, the difference is deducted from the contractors' pay. <br/> If not finishing the task causes a loss, the employer can obtain a refund of significantly higher wages of replacement workers - from the first workers' pay and from their tools, if he happens to have them. <br/> <a href = "http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a91636/go">Test your knowledge of the daf</a></body></html>
