However, strong wine may be mixed into mild wine at the time of wine-making, since it improves the taste. <br/> Rabbi Yehudah says, "A storekeeper may not distribute toasted grain or nuts to the children, because he accustoms them to come to him," but the Sages permit this. He may not lower the price of his goods below market price, but the Sages say, "He is remembered for good." <br/></body></html>
