Moreover, when someone is haughty, God says, "This world is too small for the two of us," or more precisely, " One who is haughty and proud - him I cannot bear (says God) ". <br/> <br/> And yet, a Sage must have a small measure of haughtiness. How much? One eighth of one eighth. And for a Sage it is an ornament, like the upper part of a wheat stalk. Rava said, "One who has it is damned and one who does not is damned." But it is better to err on the side of humility. <br/> <br/> When one prays though, she should definitely be humble. Follow this, " <a href = "null">Humble spirit is like God's sacrifices</a> " - which means that a prayer with a humble heart is equal not to a specific one but to all sacrifices together. <br/> <br/> Art: Old Man Praying by Rembrandt Van Rijn</body></html>
