In the times of the Second Temple the names of the coins changed. Since a common payment was a half-shekel, donated yearly by each Jew to the Temple for atonement sacrifices, this half-shekel was called a "shekel," and the full shekel was instead called a "selah". That is why our ruling was formulated in terms of "shekel by the sanctuary standard," and not just a "shekel." <br/> <br/> The same "shekel of the sanctuary standard" was used for other payments prescribed by the Torah: the fifty-shekel payment of the rapist and of the <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=22#P2127">seducer of a virgin young girl</a> , and a one hundred-shekel payment of the <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=22#P5478">defamer of his new bride</a> . <br/> <br/> These payments can be made with money or with goods, except for the half-shekel collected yearly for sacrifices. They are paid in Tyrian mintage, which was pure silver and eight times more valuable than the "provincial" coins used, for example, for a <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/09/daf-in-100-words-gittin-74-divorce-for.html">two hundred-zuz payment</a> of a Ketubah given in the case of divorce. <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?action=displayanchor&pentid=P2393#C1792">A sanctuary shekel is .8 oz. silver</a> . <br/> <br/> Art: Auguste Charpentier</body></html>
