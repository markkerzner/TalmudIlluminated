However, if the judge was regarded a legal expert by the official court and they authorized him, then he does not have to make a restitution, because he is similar to an authorized slaughterer who bungled the slaughter. <br/> <br/> If one takes a payment to inspect firstborns, his rulings are void, unless he is an exceptionally saintly person and takes a standard fee regardless of the outcome. <br/> <br/> One should not take a fee for judging, testifying, or sprinkling the waters of a red heifer, and if he does, his actions are void. Just as <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=4#P5007">God taught Torah to Moses for free</a> , so one should teach others for free. However, he can be compensated for the wages lost by taking off from work, assuming he is paid as a laborer. <br/> <br/> Art: Carl Neuman - Wise Words</body></html>
