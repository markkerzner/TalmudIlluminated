However, the Sages say that the owner is not responsible for the replacement lamb, just as he is not responsible for the second tithe, which, if lost, need not be replaced. <br/> <br/> If one buys the fetus of an idolaters cow or sells him his own cow's fetus - although he is not allowed to do so, or buys the cow jointly with an idolater - the cow is exempt from the law of firstborn, because the Torah said " <a href = "null">all firstborn in Israel</a> " - but not in other nations. <br/> <br/> By contrast, the kohanim and Levites are included in the obligation of the firstborn of kosher animals. They were only excluded from the redemption of their sons and donkeys. Thus, a kohen who owns a cow, sheep or goat that gives birth to a male as it first offspring brings it as an offering. <br/> <br/> Art:Â Willem Romeijn - Cow, Goats and Sheep in a Meadow <br/> <br/></body></html>
