The answer is that the teacher loves complicated and non-obvious derivations, and prefers to explain them first. <br/> <br/> Just as one can vow not to eat, drink, or use an object, so one can vow to become a Nazir, so that he won't drink wine, cut his hair or go to a cemetery. The laws of vows and of Nazir are parallel: one should not violate his vow nor should he delay it. <br/> <br/> However, how can one violate a "do not delay" to become a Nazir? All the time that he is not a Nazir, he is not, and there is no requirement to become one. And once he vows to be a Nazir, he is, and he is not delaying anything. <br/> <br/> This situation can be found when he says, "I will be a Nazir before I die." Since he does not know when he will die, he should become a Nazir immediately, because he might die the next moment. All the time that he does not become a Nazir, he violates the "do not delay" prohibition. This is similar to the one who says to his wife, "Here is your divorce (Get) an instant before I die." If for example she is married to a Kohen, she is immediately prohibited to eat the Kohen's portion (terumah) since he may die the very next moment, and it would come out that she ate terumah illegally. <br/> <br/> Art: A seated Peasant eating a Meal by German School</body></html>
