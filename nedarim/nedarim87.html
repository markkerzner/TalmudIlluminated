This is because the Torah said, "The husband hears (and confirms) about it," which can be translated as "even a part of it." However, if he annuls only the the figs part, he still needs to revoke the grapes. Some say that he needs to revoke the complete vow - because the Torah said, "Revokes it," meaning, the complete vow needs to be revoked. <br/> <br/> We thus see that confirming the vow and annulling it are different. There is another way to look at it. Since the Torah said that "The husband will confirm and the husband will annul," we compare the two: just as in confirming it, once he confirms part, the whole is confirmed, so is annulment: once he annuls part, the whole is annulled. This is indeed the view of Rabbi Akiva. <br/> <br/> Moreover, if she says "I am not eating grapes, and I am not eating figs" - these are two separate vows that need to be annulled separately. This is the view of Rabbi Shimon, who requires separate legal statements about everything. That is why in our rule above her forbidding grapes and figs is considered a single vow. Those who disagree will consider the initial statement as two separate vows, and the above discussion about separate annulment would not even apply. <br/> <br/> Art: A Still Life Of Grapes In A Basket by Frans Snyders</body></html>
