This onion was picked up in a Shmita year, and thus was <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin26.html">prohibited to trade</a> , to keep after there were no more such onions in the fields, and so on. However, it was replanted in the next year, experienced significant growth, and now the question is: does this new permitted growth nullify the prohibitions of the base onion, or does the new growth itself have the limitations of the Shmita produce. <br/> <br/> The reason that Rabbi Ishmael asked about the complete onion and not about just the new growth is this: the answer to this question would automatically give him the answer about the new growth. So he preferred to ask one question that combined the two. <br/> <br/> The Talmud attempts to find the answer by comparing this to other contemporary or older rulings, but finds differences; for example, in our case the onion does not completely decomposes in the ground, but other rulings may be talking about cases where a seed does decomposes. <br/> <br/> So far the question is unresolved. The question is unrelated to vows (Nedarim), but it is discussed here because on the next page the Talmud will attempt to derive a proof from an a <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/nedarim/nedarim57.html">law of vows we just learned</a> . <br/> <br/> Art: Sardines suspended from twine and onions on a stone ledge by Giuseppe Recco</body></html>
