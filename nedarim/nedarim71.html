However, this veto power only lasts for one day, after which the vow becomes valid like any other vow. Similarly, if a married woman makes a vow, her husband has a veto power for one day. <br/> <br/> If a young girl was engaged (this is complete engagement, requiring a proper divorce for dissolution) but not living with her husband yet, then both the husband and the father have the veto power, which they would exercise jointly. <br/> <br/> What happens if a girl in this situation took a vow, then divorced, or if her husband died, and then she got engaged again, on the same day? The answer does not change even if she divorced and got engaged a hundred times on this day - her father and her last-in-row husband can jointly cancel her vow during this day. <br/> <br/> We see thus that the veto power does not go over to the father on the death of the husband, but rather the father and the last-in-row husband can jointly cancel the vow; as long as the girl was not fully married, she remains in part under the jurisdiction of her father. <br/> <br/> Art: The Broken Engagement By George Bernard O'Neill</body></html>
