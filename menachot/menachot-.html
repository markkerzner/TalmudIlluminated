<br />
Once the people of Ludkiya needed oil. They appointed an agent to seek out the amount of oil bought for a million maneh, which equals to 400,000,000 golden dinars. The agent went to Jerusalem, this being the capital, but they told him to go to Tyre, which is a large port town. There, however, they directed him to Gush Chalav, in the portion of Asher.<br />
<br />
He came to Gush Chalav, and there they told him, "Go to so and so, to that certain field." There he found a Jewish farmer, who was digging and hoeing under his olive trees. The agent asked, "Do you have the amount of oil for a million maneh?" - but the farmer replied, "Please wait till I finish my work." After the farmer finished his work, he tied his tools and put them over his shoulder. As he was going, he was clearing away the stones from the field. The agent thought to himself, "Can such a hard-working man have that much oil? The Jews played a trick on me!"<br />
<br />
However, when the Jewish farmer reached his city, his maidservant brought out for him a small kettle of hot water, and he washed his hands and feet in it. Then she brought out for him a golden basin filled with oil, and he dipped his hands and feet in it, to fulfill literally the verse of "he dips his foot in oil."<br />
<br />
After they ate and drank, the farmer measured out to the agent the million maneh's worth of oil, and then he said, "Do you need any more?" The agent said, "But I have no money left!" The farmer replied to him, "Take more, and I will come and collect the payment." He measured out another 180 thousand maneh wroth of oil, and the agent had to rent every animal, horse, mule, camel, and donkey in Israel to transport the oil.<br />
<br />
The people of Ludkiya came to greet and praise their agent, but gave all honor to the farmer, who fulfilled the verse from king Solomon, "<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/13-7.htm">There is one who gives the impression of wealthy but has nothing, and there is one who gives the impression of being poor and has great wealth</a>."<br />
