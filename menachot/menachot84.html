<br />
All flour offerings must come from the choicest flour, as it says "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">all the choice of your vows</a> - and which is the choicest? The villages of Machnis and Zitcha were the "alpha" of fine flour. Next in quality was the place called Aforaim, located in the valley (as opposed to another Aforaim in the mountains). All lands were therefore acceptable, but in practice they would only bring the grain from these.<br />
