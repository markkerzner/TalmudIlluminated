However, we learn otherwise by comparing this writing to the writing of the divorce document, Get, which should be "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">on a scroll</a>," and this teaches us that  the mezuzah is written on a scroll, and is then affixed to the doorpost. <br />
<br />
But perhaps we should rather compare it to the writing of the words of the Torah on the stones, as the <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/27-3.htm">Jews did when on their entry to Israel</a>?  - We prefer to compare writing that applies in all generations (mezuzah) to writing that applies in all generations (Get), and not to writing which only happened once.<br />
<br />
A better derivation is from the words "and you will write" (uchtavtam) themselves, which can be translated as "complete writing" - that is, on the scroll, and not on the stones. Now that we have this direct derivation, what do we need the previous one for? - You might still think to engrave the words on a stone, then attach the stone to the doorpost. This teaches otherwise.<br />
