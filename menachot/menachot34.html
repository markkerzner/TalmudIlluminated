However, we learn otherwise by comparing this writing to the writing of the divorce document, Get, which should be " <a href = "null">on a scroll</a> ," and this teaches us that the mezuzah is written on a scroll, and is then affixed to the doorpost. <br/> <br/> But perhaps we should rather compare it to the writing of the words of the Torah on the stones, as the <a href = "null">Jews did when on their entry to Israel</a> ? - We prefer to compare writing that applies in all generations (mezuzah) to writing that applies in all generations (Get), and not to writing which only happened once. <br/> <br/> A better derivation is from the words "and you will write" (uchtavtam) themselves, which can be translated as "complete writing" - that is, on the scroll, and not on the stones. Now that we have this direct derivation, what do we need the previous one for? - You might still think to engrave the words on a stone, then attach the stone to the doorpost. This teaches otherwise. <br/> <br/> Art: Laurent de La Hyre - Moses and the Tablets of the Law</body></html>
