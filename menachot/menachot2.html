The minimum amount for it is 43.2 egg volumes, or between 2.5 and 4.3 liters, about one 5-pound bag of flour. A flour offering generally contains oil in the amount of one log, or six egg volumes, about half a liter.<br />
<br />
Flour offerings have four steps in their service, paralleling those of animal offerings. First a kohen takes off a handful of flour, parallel to cutting the animal's throat. Then he puts this handful in a service vessel - similar to receiving the blood. Then he carries the handful to the Altar - similar to carrying the animal's blood to the Altar. Then he burns the handful on the Altar, and the remaining flour is used for the consumption by the kohanim.<br />
<br />
There are many different types of flour offerings. If a kohen took the handful not for the sake of the right offering, it is still valid and its service needs to be completed, but it does not count toward the owner's obligation, so the owner must bring another one. The exceptions are the offerings for a sin and that of a suspected wife, which become completely invalid because of a wrong intent.<br />
