If he promises to bring frankincense, he brings at least a handful. If he promises gold, he brings a dinar, if silver - he brings a silver dinar, but if he specified how much he promised but cannot recall the amount, then he must bring enough metal until he can honestly say, "That much I could never have intended to bring."<br />
<br />
If he promised wine, he must bring no less than three measures called "log," or about one-and-a-half liter, because this was the smallest amount brought with any of the sacrifices, that is, with a lamb. If he specified the amount but does not recall it now, he brings as much as was required by the largest sacrifice.<br />
