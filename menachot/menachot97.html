The table was stationary, never carried around, and because of this should not be susceptible to spiritual impurity - except that every holiday the priests took the table and showed it to the pilgrims, to demonstrate that the bread was fresh and warm after a week, just as when it was baked. This is based on the phrase in Samuel, "<a href="http://bible.cc/1_samuel/21-6.htm">To place bread that is hot on the day it is taken off</a>."<br />
<br />
There were four props of gold on the table and twenty-eight rods, each like half a hollow reed, to separate the breads from one another, in order that they would not become moldy. This is based on  the phrase in the Torah, "<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/25-29.htm">For [the table] make bread forms,incense bowls, and side frames, as well as the half tubes that will serve as dividers [between the loaves of bread]. All these shall be made of pure gold</a>."<br />
