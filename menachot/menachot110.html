The verse continues, "and a pure flour offering" - this is talking about the one marries a wife and afterwards continues his studies. <br/> <br/> Why does it says in the Psalms, " <a href = "null">Bless God, all you servants of God, who stand in the Temple of God in the nights</a> ," since we know that the main Temple service is during the day! - This refers to those who study at night, and they are considered as if they they were engaged in the Temple service. <br/> <br/> Why does the Torah say about every sacrifice, big or small, animal, bird, or flour, that it is a "pleasing sweet smell to God?" - to tell you that whether one does much or little, it is equally pleasing to God, if done with a pure heart. <br/> <br/> Art: Gustave Leonhard de Jonghe - Kind Heart <br/></body></html>
