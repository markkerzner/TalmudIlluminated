They also did not use the grain from irrigated fields or from a field of trees, because it was not of the best quality. Such grain, though, would be acceptable after the fact.<br />
<br />
How then does one work the land to produce superior grain? He plows it the first year in the summer without sowing it in the winter. This gets rid of the thorns. Then in the second year he plows it again and now sows it, seventy days before Passover, and it produces abundant flour.<br />
<br />
How does one examine the flour? The Temple treasurer inserts his hand into it, and if dust comes up in his hand, the flour is invalid until he sifts it again. If the flour became wormy, it is permanently disqualified.<br />
