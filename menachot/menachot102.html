For example, the Red Heifer was slaughtered in a designated place on the Mount of Olives, facing the portals of the Temple. It was then burned in a pit, and its ashes used for purification from the ritual impurity of the dead.<br />
<br />
In this procedure, there is not a moment when its meat can be eaten. However, since there is a time period when it can be redeemed, that is, after slaughter and before its blood is sprinkled, Rabbi Shimon considers it legally as if it had been redeemed, and therefore could have been eaten, with the result that it is now subject to the laws of food contamination.<br />
<br />
The principle of "all that stands to..." reappears in various areas. For example, according to Rabbi Shimon, the blood that stands to be thrown can be considered as if thrown. On a more practical level, the debts that stand to be collected by the court can be considered as if collected, with the result that the court can treat monetary obligations transferable as real money.<br />
