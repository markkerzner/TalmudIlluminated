<br />
If the animal, after slaughter, was found to be sick and non-viable, then, since it had this defect from before, the breads did not become sanctified. If the animal was found to have a minor blemish in the eye, then Rabbi Eliezer says that the breads did become sanctified, because once this animal is on the Altar, it need not be brought down, but the Sages disagree.<br />
<br />
Some sacrifices require libations, which may include wine and flour. These, unlike the breads of the thanksgiving, get sanctified on their own, once they touch the Temple vessel. If such libations became sanctified and then their sacrifices was found to be invalid, then if there is another sacrifice in need of libations, they can be brought with it, but if not, they become disqualified at night and are subsequently destroyed. Others opine that libations get sanctified with the slaughter. <br />
