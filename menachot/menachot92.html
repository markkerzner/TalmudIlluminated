If it was a sin-offering, he confessed his sin, and if it was a thanksgiving offering, he offered thanks to God. <br />
<br />
Communal offerings do not require leaning, except for the bull that comes for communal violations, and the he-goat dispatched to Azazel on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Shimon says that the he-goat for communal idolatry required leaning. There was a tradition that exactly two communal offerings required leaning, but they argued about which they were.<br />
<br />
All private offering required leaning, except for the first-born, tithe, and Passover offering. If one's father died and left a sacrifice, his son brings that sacrifice, performs leaning, brings the libations, and even has the power to appoint a replacement sacrifice. As we learned before, when one appoints a replacement, both animals become sacrifices, but to effect this, one needs to be a complete owner, and this teaches us that the son is a complete owner.<br />
