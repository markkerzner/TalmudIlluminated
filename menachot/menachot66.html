They would bring it into the Courtayrd of the Temple and roast it over fire, in order to fullfill <a href = "null">the mitzvah of toasting</a> Â - these are the words of Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say that before roasting the barley they would beat it with soft reeds and stems, to remove the kernels from the stalks without crushing them, and then they would put it into a copper pipe to be roasted. The pipe was perforated to spread the fire over all of it. <br/> <br/> After the barley was threshed and roasted, they spread it out in the Courtyard, to let the wind blow over it to dry it. They would then put it into a bean mill and grind it coarsely. Then they would sift it with thirteen sieves, extracting one-tenth of the total volume as fine flour. The remainder had to be redeemed with money and then could be eaten by anyone. <br/> <br/> Art: Joseph Henderson - Through The Barley</body></html>
