If he did it in his linen white vestments, he now sanctifies his hands and feet (by washing them from the golden flask), undresses, descends into the mikveh, immerses, ascends and dries himself. They bring him the golden vestments; he dresses and again sanctifies his hands and feet. <br/> <br/> Then he continues with two services: his ram and the ram of the nation: he slaughters them, receives their blood and throws it on the Altar, and burns there the sacrificial parts. Then he sacrifices seven sheep (Rabbi Akiva says that he sacrifices them in the morning, together with the daily offering). <br/> <br/> The High Priest then changes into white linen vestments again, with appropriate washings of the hands and feet - and returns to the Holy of Holies, to remove from there the ladle and the coal-pan. <br/> <br/> Art:Â Two Rams In A Landscape by Rosa Bonheur</body></html>
