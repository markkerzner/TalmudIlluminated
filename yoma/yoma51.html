He walks through the Sanctuary until he reaches the two curtains that separate it and the Holy of Holies. The space between two curtains measured one amah (about two feet). Rabbi Yose says that there was only one curtain, as the Torah describes it, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=26#P2266">And the curtain shall divide between the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies.</a>" <br />

They says that this was true in the First Temple, which was relatively low. There the wall, which had a thickness of one amah, served as a partition, and a door in that wall was use as an entrance. However, the Second Temple was higher, and the wall could no longer stand on its own, due to its weight. Therefore, there were two curtains instead, marking the outer and inner parts of the would-be wall.
