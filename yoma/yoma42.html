However, when Rav Dimi came back from one of this numerous learning trips to Israel, he brought back a teaching of Rabbi Yochanan, which was later enhanced by Rabbi Yonatan, and they said that there were three such strips. They also provided the minimal measures: the strip for burning the red heifer was the heaviest, the weight of ten "zuz" coins - since it had to land inside the fire in which the red heifer was burning. Next was the strip tied to the horns of the sent-away goat and, since it had to be divided in two, it needed a minimum of two "sela" coins, or eight "zuz." Finally, the third one was used in the purification of a leper (metzorah), and it could be as light as four zuz. Thus the question was now completely resolved.<br />
<br />
On the subject of the red heifer, the Torah said that "it will be slaughtered in front of Elazar the priest." From here we see that one who slaughters it does not have to be a priest (Kohen). Others say that since it is a Temple service, the one who slaughters had to be a priest also. Regardless, the High Priests made a point of always slaughtering the red heifer themselves, and otherwise showing their appreciation for this mitzvah.<br />
