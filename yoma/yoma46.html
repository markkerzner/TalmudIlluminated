It was fired even on Shabbat, and therein lies the problem: lighting fire on Shabbat is prohibited. We understand that the Temple service overrides this rule, but to what extent? Therefore, Rav Avin qualified it: the pyre is started even for invalid (such as ritually impure) parts, but however, only if fire has singed them.  
<br />
<br />
There are two potential prohibitions that need to be overridden when burning sacrifices in the Temple: Shabbat and ritual impurity. Rav Huna said that it is the first one that is overridden, but not the second one, and Rabbah said that it is only the second one. Abaye asked a question that is a problem equally for  both: the Torah said, "Bring the sacrifice in its time" which seems to mean, "even on Shabbat and even if ritually impure." Why prefer one exemption and leave out the other?
<br />
<br />
However, both have their answers. Rabbah uses the rule "ending should be like the beginning," that is, since in the beginning of bringing the sacrifice we may suspend the laws of purity if we have no alternative, so too in the end we can burn parts that have become impure, and there is no such logic for Shabbat. On the other hand, Rav Huna does not agree to the "ending like the beginning" principle, rather, he says that Shabbat can be abrogated in this case, since communal sacrifices are freely brought on Shabbat, but we never totally dispense with the laws of purity.
