What garments did it have to be performed in? That answer depends on the argument whether it was a real service or just a preparation, with the conclusion that it was a real service, and thus the regular four items of the Kohen's attire were required. 
<br />
<br />
How much of the ashes had to be put down on the ground next to the Altar. Should we learn from the separation of tithes and say it is one-tenth, or from the separation of the booty of Midian and say it was one in five hundred? The conclusion is that we should learn from the separation of the flour offering, and it was a handful.
<br />
<br />
At times, besides the symbolic removal of the ashes, there was a real cleaning. What garments should this be performed in (they are called "other garments" in the Torah) - better or worse quality? Using the principle that "when a servant mixes wine for his master, he should not use the same garments as when he is preparing a dish for his master," we conclude that the removal of the ashes was done in better quality garments. 
<br />
<br />
In general, if  a non-Kohen performs a Temple service, he is liable to death at the hand of Heaven. However, only a complete, final service carries that responsibility. For example, is a non-Kohen liable for arranging the lamps of the Menora? - No, because there are also wicks. Is he liable or the wicks? - No, because there is also putting them in the lamps? Is he liable for that then? - No, because there is also putting oil. And he is not liable for it either, because there is also kindling. Then surely he must be liable for kindling!? - No, he just holds a flame to the wick, and the wick ignites by itself.
