Both had their source in the Torah and were connected to the initial consecration of the Levites for the services, when they likewise <a href = "null">spent seven days near the Tabernacle, separated from the rest</a> . Back then the Levites did it "to do" "atonement:" For the future, "to do" refers to the Red Heifer, and "atonement" to Yom Kippur. <br/> <br/> Art: Solitude by Marc Chagall</body></html>
