Just forbidden, you say? But it is more than this, one is liable to being cut off from the Jewish people and from his spiritual source! - The rule above is talking about a small amount, which is still forbidden. OK, this answer is good according to those who say that small amount of forbidden food is actually prohibited by the Torah. However, if the Torah does not mind a small amount, then what is this rule talking about? - That it is still prohibited by the Sages. <br/> <br/> What is the basis for this disagreement? Rabbi Yochanan says that since small amounts do add to the amount which is prohibited by the Torah, it must be that these small amounts are themselves prohibited, for otherwise where does the prohibition come from? However, Resh Lakish says that eating a small amount is not called "eating," and thus it is simply not included in the prohibition. <br/> <br/> So how is one supposed to "afflict his soul?" Perhaps it means sitting in the sun on a hot day, or in the shade on a cold one? - No, the nature of the required suffering is such that one refrains from such activities as eating, drinking, etc., but not that one actively seeks out to increase his suffering. <br/> <br/> Art: Thirst By William-Adolphe Bouguereau</body></html>
