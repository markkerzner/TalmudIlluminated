They bring him the Torah, he stands up, receives it, and reads passages about Yom Kippur. If he wants to do this in the linen white garments, in which he was performing the service, he is allowed to, or else he can use his own garments. In general, can Kohanim wear the service garments outside the Temple? Let us consider the following story. <br/> <br/> In the time of Shimon the Righteous, the Karaites convinced Alexander of Macedonia that the Jews organized a rebellion, and he moved to destroy Jerusalem. Shimon the High Priest donned his garments and went to meet him. Both parties walked all night and met at sunrize, when Alexander descended from his chariot and bowed down to Shimon. He explained that every time he went to battle, he saw this man in a vision, praying for him. Alexander then gave the Karaites into the hands of the Jews, who dragged them tied to horses to the Karaite Temple on Mount Gerizim, and destroyed it. <br/> <br/> From this story we see that a Kohen is allowed to wear his garments outside! - Maybe these were not the real garments but only similar to them. <br/> <br/> In proving that one can indeed sit in the Women's Courtyard, the Talmud quotes a phrase from Nehemiah. It then continues with the events of that time. The Sages saw that the Evil Inclination has already succeeded in convincing people to be worship idols, which led to the destruction of the First Temple, and fasted and prayed for three days for God to remove it. They were given this, and it came out of the Holy of Holies in the form of the roaring lion made of fire. They hid it away in a special magical vessel made of lead, and the desire to worship idols was much weakened. <br/> <br/> Seeing that they had favor with God, they asked to destroy the desire for illicit relations, but the world stopped functioning, and they could not even find a fresh egg for a sick person. Some say, the "fresh egg" is a prayer on Shabbat, and it was not special like it always is. Understanding that they would not be granted to remove the desire only for illicit relations, they were at least able to abolish the urge for one's relatives. <br/> <br/> Art:Â Still Life With Jugs And Eggs by Theodule Augustine Ribot <br/> <br/></body></html>
