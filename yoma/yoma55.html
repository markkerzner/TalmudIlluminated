The blood never really lands on the Arks itself, "up" and "down" refers to the direction of his fingers, in a whipping motion. <br/> <br/> To make sure that he maintains the correct count, he says out loud, "One, one-and-one, one-and-twoâ€¦ and so on.. one-and-seven." - since any mistake in the counting would invalidate the whole procedure. <br/> <br/> The High Priest then takes the blood of the goat, puts down the blood of the bull, re-enters the Holy of Holies and sprinkles the blood of the goat, counting again, "One, one-and-one, etc." Finally, he pours the blood of the bull into the blood of the goat and then pours it all back, to make the two types of blood thoroughly mixed. <br/> <br/> Art: A Rocky Landscape With A Bull, Goat, Ram And Sheepdog By Philipp Peter Roos</body></html>
