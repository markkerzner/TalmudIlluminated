The blood never really lands on the Arks itself, "up" and "down" refers to the direction of his fingers, in a whipping motion. 
<br />
<br />
To make sure that he maintains the correct count, he says out loud, "One, one-and-one, one-and-twoâ€¦ and so on.. one-and-seven." - since any mistake in the counting would invalidate the whole procedure.
<br />
<br />
The High Priest then takes the blood of the goat, puts down the blood of the bull, re-enters the Holy of Holies and sprinkles the blood of the goat, counting again, "One, one-and-one, etc." Finally, he pours the blood of the bull into the blood of the goat  and then pours it all back, to make the two types of blood thoroughly mixed.
