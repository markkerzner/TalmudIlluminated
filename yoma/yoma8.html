It fixes the defects of the sacrifices, so that even those sacrifices that were not normally acceptable, become so with the help of the Tzitz. This is expressed by the Torah as follows, " <a href = "null">So that Aaron will bear the sin of the sacred offerings</a> ." <br/> <br/> However, which offerings could the Tzitz help? If the priest bringing it wanted to eat it in the wrong place, it " <a href = "null">would not be acceptable</a> ," and if he even wanted to eat it in the wrong time, it " <a href = "null">would not be considered</a> ." Thus, the only problem that the Tzitz could fix was the offering that became ritually impure. <br/> <br/> Did the Tzitz have to be on the forehead of the High Priest to be effective? That depends on the understanding of the word "always (Aaron will wear it)." You can understand that whenever Aaron wears it, it is effective, but not otherwise. Or, you can say that "always" means "constantly when possible," but even when it is not possible to wear it (such as during sleep), it still works. The Talmud tries to resolve its earlier question,Â  <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/yoma/yoma7.html">whether the laws of purity are completely abrogated or if they only allow a few exceptions</a> , using the laws of Tzitz, but alas, Tzitz allows both interpretations. Incidentally, it is from Tzitz that we derive that one who wears <a href = "null">tefillin</a> must be constantly mindful of them. <br/> <br/> Art: Yemeni Jew, 1914 National Geographic Magazine.</body></html>
