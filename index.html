<br>
This site took seven-and-a-half years to compose. Every day I would
learn a page of Talmud, in the order of Daf Yomi, and write a clear,
concise description of the major topics discussed on that page. The
Talmud covers many areas, from divorce to marriage (in this order),
civil and criminal laws, and Temple service. It also contains many
stories. By now, the project is complete, but I am still working on the
improvements. This is my fourth time learning the complete 2711 pages
of Talmud.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">About myself.</span> My name is Mark Kerzner, I live in Houston, TX, I am married with six children, and I have a cat and a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dog</span>
fish. I am a full-time software developer and trainer in Big Data, and
part-time many other things, such as learning the Talmud.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Talmud Illuminated?</span> <br>
<br>
I want to open knowledge to anybody to wants it. Let us
say someone wants to know about Kiddushin (Jewish marriage). He can
take the very good editions of <a href="http://new.steinsaltz.org/talmud/">Steinzalts</a> or <a href="http://www.artscroll.com/">Artscroll</a>,
and study all of the eighty-two pages. This will take eight-two hours,
or more, depending on the level of preparation. Or she can get the
general idea by reading the pages on the Talmud Illuminated site, and
then go ahead and deepen that knowledge. <br>


<br>
Each page is described in about two hundred words. It is illustrated
with a carefully selected painting from world art. It can serve as a
knowledge journey, or art journey or both. You can subscribe to a daily
email, and after seven years ofdaily reading <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">But why study the Talmud?</span> <br>
<br>
I personally two reasons. First, I wanted to <span style="font-weight: bold;">have the knowledge</span>. Second, learning is an excellent mental gymnastics. When I started a
while back, I had this idea: "I am reasonably astute now, but what will
be later, when I grow older? Let me engage in daily learning, and see
what happens years later." I am still doing it.<br>
