Chiya bar Abba encountered Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levy, who had hurriedly
thrown a sheet upon his head and was bringing his grandchild to the
synagogue for this Torah lesson. He asked, &#8220;What is all this rush
about?&#8221;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levy replied, &nbsp;-
is it a small thing to fulfill that which is written in Shema, &#8220;You
shall make them known to your children and grandchildren,&#8221; and next to
this, &#8220;The day that you stood before Hashem your God at Chorev?&#8221; We see
from here that teaching Torah to one's grandchild is tantamount to
receiving Torah at Sinai.</div></body></html>
