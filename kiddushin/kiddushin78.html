If one testifies that his son is a mamzer, and even if both parents say this about a fetus, they are not believed, because a man can not testify against himself. But Rabbi Yehudah says that they are believed, because a man is believed to say "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">this is my first-born son</a>," and so also about a mamzer.
