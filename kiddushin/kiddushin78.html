However, if he cohabits with her again, he renders her a chalalah. <br/> <br/> If one testifies that his son is a mamzer, and even if both parents say this about a fetus, they are not believed, because a man can not testify against himself. But Rabbi Yehudah says that they are believed, because a man is believed to say " <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">this is my first-born son</a> ," and so also about a mamzer.</body></html>
