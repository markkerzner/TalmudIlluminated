Although the grandfather can not marry his granddaughter, he can designate her to marry his son, the girl's uncle, which is allowed by the Torah.<br />
<br />
A master, who strikes a Canaanite slave and deprives him of his tooth or eye, must set him free. In contrast, a Hebrew servant in this situation receives payment but not freedom.<br />
<br />
If a servant has a wife or children when he begins his term of servitude, then his master may give him a Canaanite slave-woman as a mate.
