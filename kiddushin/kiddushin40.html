certain noblewoman propositioned Rabbi Tzadok. He said to her: &#8220;My
heart is weak and I can not do it. Is there anything to eat?&#8221; She said
to him: &#8220;There is some non-kosher meat.&#8221; He said to her: &#8220;What is to be
deduced from this? That whoever performs this eats this.&#8221;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>She
lit the oven and put the meat inside it. Rabbi Tsadok climbed up and
sat inside the oven (he was allowed sacrifice his life because of his
great stature). She said to him: &#8220;Had I known that you regard the
matter as so severe, I would not have bothered you.&#8221;</div></body></html>
