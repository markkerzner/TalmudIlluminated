Hebrew servant who has sold himself into servitude and wants to redeem
himself early enjoys a special privilege: his redemption price is the
lower of his purchase price and the current value of his service for
the remaining years.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Through the sequence of
Torah passages, we can deduce which transgressions caused him to become
poor and sell himself. Still, now that he wants to become free again,
he gets a leniency.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>He can reduce his
remaining years of servitude with a partial payment, but this can
result either in a gain or a loss for him, if his price fluctuates.</div></body></html>
