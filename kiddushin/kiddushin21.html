<div>
A Hebrew servant who has sold himself into servitude and wants to redeem himself early enjoys a special privilege: his redemption price is the lower of his purchase price and the current value of his service for the remaining years. </div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
Through the sequence of Torah passages, we can deduce which transgressions caused him to become poor and sell himself. Still, now that he wants to become free again, he gets a leniency. </div>
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
He can reduce his remaining years of servitude with a partial payment, but this can result either in a gain or a loss for him, if his price fluctuates.</div>
