He has to tell his brothers, "Take these idols, and I will take the produce," before the idols come into his possession. <br/> <br/> A father can sell his daughter into servitude only once. Her master or master's son are expected to marry her and provide for her, with no additional Kiddushin money required. <br/> <br/> A Hebrew servant is sold for his theft if he can not repay, but only if what he owes exceeds the value of the six years of his servitude.</body></html>
