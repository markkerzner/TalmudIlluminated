A guarantor of a loan, even though he does not personally receive the benefit, still binds himself to repay. So too she commits herself, in return for the money based on her say-so. <br/> <br/> A special man who also never accepts gifts (none today) can marry a woman by giving her the pleasure of accepting her gift.</body></html>
