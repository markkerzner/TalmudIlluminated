6 - Terms of Endearment</a>

How is Kiddushin brought about through money? When a man gives a women
money or items worth money and says, &#8220;Behold, you are betrothed to me -
Harei at mekudeshet li&#8221;, and she agrees, she is betrothed.<br>
<br>
Anyone
who does not know the laws of divorce documents and Kiddushin should
have no dealings with them, for an unwitting error in the decision
could prove intractable.<br>

woman can not be betrothed by forgoing the repayment of a loan. The
loan is given for expenses, with the obligation to repay, thus he is
not giving her anything of value at this moment.
