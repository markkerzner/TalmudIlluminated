a father of a minor girl commissioned an agent to find a husband for
her and accept the betrothal money, and the father himself then went
and betrothed her to someone, then if the father's betrothal occurred
first, then it is valid, and if the agent's betrothal occurred first,
then it is the one that is valid.<br><br>If it is unknown whose
betrothal occurred first, then she cannot marry another man unless both
give her a Get. And if they want, one of them can give her a Get and
the other one can marry her.
