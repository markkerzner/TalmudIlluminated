one betroths a woman with a loan, she is not betrothed, for a loan is
given to be spent. Thus, a man cannot say to a woman, "I forgive you
the loan, and with that money become betrothed to me," because at this
time the money is hers. Instead, he can forgive her the loan and
betroth her with the benefit she receives from no longer having to
repay him.<br><br>If a man said to a woman, "Become betrothed to me
with $100", but gave her only $1, she is betrothed, and the man must
pay later.</body></html>
