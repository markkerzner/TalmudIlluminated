Even though the Torah says in many places, "Speak to the sons of Israel," the following phrase makes men and women equal: "When a man or a woman commit any sin that men commit."<br />
<br />
Another phrase, "These are the ordinances that you shall set before them," equates a woman to a man in all the laws involving monetary payments.<br />
<br />
Women are exempt from the prohibition of cutting off peyot (corners of the hair on the head) and a daughter of a Kohen is allowed to visit a cemetery.
