commandments of the Torah apply equally to women and men. Even though
the Torah says in many places, "Speak to the sons of Israel," the
following phrase makes men and women equal: "When a man or a woman
commit any sin that men commit."<br><br>Another phrase, "These are the
ordinances that you shall set before them," equates a woman to a man in
all the laws involving monetary payments.<br><br>Women are exempt from
the prohibition of cutting off peyot (corners of the hair on the head)
and a daughter of a Kohen is allowed to visit a cemetery.
