to Rabbi Tarfon, a mamzer can marry a slavewoman, have children with
her who get her status of slaves, then free them, and they become free
Jews and not mamzerim. However, Rabbi Eliezer says that the children
are still mamzerim.<br><br>Ten genealogical classes went up from
Babylonia to Israel: Kohanim, Leviim, Israelim, Chalalim (disqualified
Kohanim), converts, freed Canaanite slaves, mamzerim (illegitimate),
Netinim (Gibeonites), Shetukim (whose mother silences him about the
father) and Asufim (foundlings, or ones gathered in).<br><br>Kohanim,
Levvim, and Yisraelim are permitted to marry each other. Leviim,
Israelim, chalalim, converts and freed slaves are permitted to marry
each other.
