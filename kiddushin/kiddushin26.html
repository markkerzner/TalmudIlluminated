Shimon says that only lifting the animal acquires it. Then how does
Rabbi Shimon acquire elephants? By having them step on bundles of vines.<br><br>Real
property may be acquired by means of money, a document, or a
proprietary act such as locking the gate. Movable property may be
acquired only by "drawing it near." To protect buyers, the Rabbis
abrogated the power of money to acquire so that sellers would guard the
sold goods after receiving the money.
