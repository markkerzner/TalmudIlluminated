<br />
Reverence means that the son may not  not sit in his father's place, he may not contradict his father in words in his presence - but he may offer challenges to his father's position until a conclusion is reached.<br />
<br />
Honor means that he must give his father food and drink, dress him and cover him, bring him in and take him out.<br />
<br />
The same applies to his mother.<br />
<br />
The son is not required to pay for his parents' needs out of his own pocket, but merely to expend the effort.
