means that the son may not not sit in his father's place, he may not
contradict his father in words in his presence &#8211; but he may offer
challenges to his father's position until a conclusion is reached.<br><br>Honor means that he must give his father food and drink, dress him and cover him, bring him in and take him out.<br><br>The same applies to his mother.<br><br>The son is not required to pay for his parents' needs out of his own pocket, but merely to expend the effort.
