a priest betroths a woman with his portion of the sacrificial offering,
whether most-holy (such as burnt-offering and sin-offering) or an
offering of lesser holiness (such as peace offering and
thanks-offering), she is not betrothed. The portions allotted to the
priest and the owner of the offering are not theirs, but rather Divine
property which they are merely permitted to eat.<br><br>But it may be
asked, how can a woman come in the Inner Temple courtyard to accept
Kiddushin? Her father can accept her Kiddushin, she can appoint an
agent, or she can force her way in!
