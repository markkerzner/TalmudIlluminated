The portions allotted to the priest and the owner of the offering are not theirs, but rather Divine property which they are merely permitted to eat.<br />

But it may be asked, how can a woman come in the Inner Temple courtyard to accept Kiddushin? Her father can accept her Kiddushin, she can appoint an agent, or she can force her way in!
