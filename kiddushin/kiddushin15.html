A man who steals and can not repay, who is sold by the courts in order to pay the one he robbed;</p><p>2. A girl under the age of twelve who is sold by her father;</p><p>3. A man who sells himself because of his poverty;</p><p>4. A Jew who sells himself to a gentile.</p><p>A servant sold by the court can be given a Canaanite slave-woman in order to have children.<br><br>Even today there is a way for a mamzer (illegitimate) to have kosher children from a Canaantie slave-woman.</p></body></html>
