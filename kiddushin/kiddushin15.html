<br />
<br />
1. A man who steals and can not repay, who is sold by the courts in order to pay the one he robbed;<br />
2. A girl under the age of twelve who is sold by her father;<br />
3. A man who sells himself because of his poverty;<br />
4. A Jew who sells himself to a gentile.<br />
A servant sold by the court can be given a Canaanite slave-woman in order to have children.<br /><br />Even today there is a way for a mamzer (illegitimate) to have kosher children from a Canaantie slave-woman.
