A man who steals and can not repay, who is sold by the courts in order to pay the one he robbed; <br/> 2. A girl under the age of twelve who is sold by her father; <br/> 3. A man who sells himself because of his poverty; <br/> 4. A Jew who sells himself to a gentile. <br/> A servant sold by the court can be given a Canaanite slave-woman in order to have children. <br/> <br/> Even today there is a way for a mamzer (illegitimate) to have kosher children from a Canaantie slave-woman.</body></html>
