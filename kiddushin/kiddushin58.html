idolatry it says &#8220;you shall not bring it into your house and become
banned like it,&#8221; which means that whatever you generate from the sale
of idols is forbidden, but other money is permitted. But maybe this
teaches the rule, not an exception? - No, because there is another
exception where money is forbidden, that is, fruit of the seventh year.
Money from the sale of other items are permitted.
