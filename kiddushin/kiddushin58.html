Regarding idolatry it says "you shall not bring it into your house and become banned like it," which means that whatever you generate from the sale of idols is forbidden, but other money is permitted. But maybe this teaches the rule, not an exception? - No, because there is another exception where money is forbidden, that is, fruit of the seventh year. Money from the sale of other items are permitted.
