There are many items, such as meat cooked in milk, that are prohibited not only to eat, but also to use. Thus, their value
is intrinsically zero. If one uses such an item to betroth a woman, she remains free. We listed these items <a href="kiddushin56.html">earlier.</a>
    However, if he does (illegally) sell such item, then
    the money that he recieves from this sales is not prohibited. If he now betroths a woman with this money, she is bound to him. How do we know that?
<br/> <br/> Regarding idolatry it says <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=7#P5132">
    "You shall not bring it into your house and become banned like it."</a>
This means that whatever you generate from the sale of idols is forbidden, but if you sell other prohibited items, that money is permitted. 
    But how do we know that this indeed is an exception? Perhaps, just the opposite, it teaches us a general rule, and any time one sells a prohibited item, 
    that money is prohibited as well?
But maybe this teaches the rule, not an exception? - The end of the phrase states, "since it is taboo." The word "it" is extra. It teaches us
    that only "it" is taboo, but not the money from the sale of other prohibited items.
