sources are needed to prove that a father keeps both the earnings and
the money of his minor daughter's Kiddushin. One might think that she
does not work to receive Kiddushin money, and thus the father keeps it.
Alternatively, one might think that the father feeds her, and thus
keeps her earnings.<br><br>Another source why money is effective for Kiddushin is "When a man <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">takes</span> a woman", because Efron said to Avraham, "<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Take</span> this field from me" - for money.<br><br>Efron's
reincarnation was Aravna, who sold the location of the Temple to King
David honestly and generously, correcting Efron's deed.
