man betrothed a woman by giving her a quantity of silk. He said,
&#8220;Become betrothed to me with $2,000, and here is this silk as payment.&#8221;
The silk was indeed worth $2,000. Does the woman, who is not an expert
in appraisal, rely on his words and wholeheartedly commit herself in
marriage? The prevailing ruling is that she does.<br><br>If a man said
to a woman, &#8220;Become betrothed to me with $100,&#8221; but instead gave her an
item as collateral, she is not betrothed. She did not receive the
promised money, nor was collateral given as a gift.
