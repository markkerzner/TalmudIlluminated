are not obligated to do mitzvot which are related to time, such as
dwelling in a succah or hearing the shofar, although they observe these
as a custom. They are also not obligated to learn those areas of the
Torah which have no practical applicability nowadays.<br><br>Women are
obligated to affix mezuzot to their doorposts, because for this the
Torah promises long life, and women need long life just as men do.<br><br>Women
are obligated in all the negative commandments of Passover, such as not
eating bread, and therefore all of the positive commandments of
Passover, such as eating matzah.
