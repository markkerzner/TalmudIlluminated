one says to a woman: "Become betrothed to me with this date," then
again "Become betrothed to me with this date"; if either one of these
dates has the value of a prutah, she is betrothed, and if not, she is
not betrothed.<br><br>If he hands her the dates and says: "Become
betrothed to me with this, with this, and with this," if there is the
value of a prutah in all of them combined, she is betrothed.<br><br>If she was eating the dates one by one, she is not betrothed unless one of them has the value of a prutah.
