<br />
If he hands her the dates and says: "Become betrothed to me with this, with this, and with this," if there is the value of a prutah in all of them combined, she is betrothed.<br />
<br />
If she was eating the dates one by one, she is not betrothed unless one of them has the value of a prutah.
