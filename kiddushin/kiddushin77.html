child born from a union between a Kohen and a woman who is forbidden to
him due to his status as a Kohen is not imbued with Kohanic sanctity.
He may not perform the Temple service and he is not subject to the
prohibition against going to the cemetery.<br><br>Women prohibited to a
Kohen include a divorcee, a convert, and a woman who cohabited with any
man whom she is Biblically forbidden to marry.<br><br>If a male convert marries a female convert, their daughter is allowed to marry a Kohen.
