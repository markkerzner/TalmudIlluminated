Canaanite slave may be acquired by means of money, a document, or a
proprietary act of serving his new master, such as removing his
master's shoe or lifting him.<br><br>Can we derive from here that a
Canaanite slave-woman can be acquired by sexual intercourse, because
she is lifting her master? - No, this is not comparable to regular
lifting where the lifter does not get any pleasure. How about anal
intercourse where she is not getting pleasure? Who is to say that she
is not getting any pleasure? - Disproved! A slave-woman can not be
acquired in this way.</body></html>
