an animal suitable for an offering was found between Jerusalem and
Migdal Eder or at a similar distance (4 miles) from Jerusalem, males
are treated as burnt offerings, and females are treated as peace
offerings.<br><br>But males can also be peace offerings! - We treat
them with the stringencies of both, thus, if someone steps forward and
voluntarily obligates himself for the monetary value of the lost animal
to redeem it, he needs to consecrate the value of both (Rabbi Meir).<br><br>Rabbi Yochanan: But redemption, though effective, is not allowed! - He waits for the animal to get a blemish and be redeemed.
