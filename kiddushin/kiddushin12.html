to Beit Hillel, the minimum amount of money needed for Kiddushin is a
small coin called a prutah. This does not mean the smallest coin in
circulation. Rather, it is the value of one-half of a barleycorn of
silver, and it is estimated anew each generation.<br><br>If a man
betrothed a woman by handing her a date with a value of less than a
prutah, there is still a possibility that in some place this date is
worth more than a prutah. Therefore, he should repeat the Kiddushin
with a definite value, or give her a Get.
