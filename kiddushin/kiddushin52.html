about a man who betrothed five women with a basket of figs, collected
in the Sabbatical year, and belonging to the women, we can draw three
conclusions:<br><br>- One can betroth with the produce of the
Sabbatical year, even though it is ownerless while it grows, because
collecting this produce is allowed;<br>- If one betroths with stolen goods, even if they are the bride's, the betrothal is invalid;<br>- A woman can become an agent of betrothal for another woman, even where she also becomes a rival wife.
