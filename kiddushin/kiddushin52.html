<br />
- One can betroth with the produce of the Sabbatical year, even though it is ownerless while it grows, because collecting this produce is allowed;<br />
- If one betroths with stolen goods, even if they are the bride's, the betrothal is invalid;<br />
- A woman can become an agent of betrothal for another woman, even where she also becomes a rival wife.
