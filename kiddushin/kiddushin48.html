If a creditor sells a note of indebtedness to his fellow and afterwards
forgives the debt - it is indeed forgiven. Therefore, if one betroths a
woman by giving her a loan document for collection, she may fear that
he will forgive the debt, and thus she does not wholeheartedly commit
herself to the betrothal, which is therefore void.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SSzObwMHh4I/AAAAAAAAAfg/ecpXoQ2fe1k/s1600-h/Andries+Vermeulen+-+Still+Life+Jewellery+Casket.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 200px; height: 117px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SSzObwMHh4I/AAAAAAAAAfg/ecpXoQ2fe1k/s200/Andries+Vermeulen+-+Still+Life+Jewellery+Casket.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272816239931524994" border="0"></a><br><br>If
a woman handed a piece of gold to a craftsman and said to him: "Fashion
for me anklets, earrings, or rings, and in return for your labor I will
become betrothed to you," - it is betrothal with a a loan, which is
invalid.</body></html>
