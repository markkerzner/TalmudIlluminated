Who searches after whom? The one that lost his possession searches for it.<br />

Why can betrothal be effected with money, and furthermore, why does the father of  a bride who is a minor keep the money? From the law of a Jewish servant girl who goes free at twelve - "free, without money" - we know that there must be another case "with money" - that is, Kiddushin, which is in general effective with money.
