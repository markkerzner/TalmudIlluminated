is the way of a man to search after a wife, and not the other way
around - similar to a person who lost a possession. Who searches after
whom? The one that lost his possession searches for it.<br><br>Why can
betrothal be effected with money, and furthermore, why does the father
of a bride who is a minor keep the money? From the law of a Jewish
servant girl who goes free at twelve - &#8220;free, without money&#8221; - we know
that there must be another case &#8220;with money&#8221; - that is, Kiddushin,
which is in general effective with money.
