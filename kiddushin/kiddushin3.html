It
is the way of a man to search after a wife, and not the other way around - similar to a person who lost a possession.
Who searches after whom? The one that lost his possession searches for it. <br/> <br/> Why can betrothal be effected
with money, and furthermore, why does the father of a bride who is a minor keep the money? From the law of a Jewish
servant girl who goes free at twelve - "free, without money" - we know that there must be another case "with money" -
that is, Kiddushin, which is in general effective with money.
