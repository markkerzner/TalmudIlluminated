<ul>
<li>completion of six years of service;</li>
<li>the onset of the Jubilee year;</li>
<li>paying his purchase price back to his master, minus the cash equivalent of the years already served;</li>
<li>death of his master.</li>
</ul>
A Hebrew maidservant sold by her father, in addition to all the ways of a Hebrew servant, goes free when she reaches twelve years of age and has "signs of physical maturity" (two pubic hairs).<br />
<br />
When a Hebrew servant or maidservant go free, they receive severance gifts.
