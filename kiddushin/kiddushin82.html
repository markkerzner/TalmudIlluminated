Meir says: "One should always teach his son a clean and easy trade, and
he should pray to He to Whom all wealth and possessions belong, because
there is no trade that does not include indigence and wealth. For
poverty is not the result of a trade, nor is wealth the result of a
trade; rather, all is in accordance with one's merit."<br><br>Rabbi
Nehorai says: "I put aside every trade in the world and I teach my son
only Torah, for a man benefits from its reward in this world, and the
principal remains for him in the World to Come."</body></html>
