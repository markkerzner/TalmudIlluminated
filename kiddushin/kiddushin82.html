For poverty is not the result of a trade, nor is wealth the result of a trade; rather, all is in accordance with one's merit." <br/> <br/> Rabbi Nehorai says: "I put aside every trade in the world and I teach my son only Torah, for a man benefits from its reward in this world, and the principal remains for him in the World to Come." <br/> <br/> Mystical meaning of Kiddushin <br/> <br/> The bride is symbolic of Tzedek - righteousness and also of being poor. When she is given a coin - a prutah - the minimum amount for giving, she becomes symbolic of Tzedakah, charity. She then turns her face to the groom, and this face-to-face meeting, symbolic of God talking to Moses, prepares them for the honor of Chupah. <br/> <br/> Mystical meaning of Chanukah (Since today is Chanukah) <br/> <br/> Chanukah is the contrast between " <a href = "http://bible.cc/proverbs/31-30.htm">Beauty is vanity but God-fearing woman, she should be praised</a> ," and Kiddushin symbolizes this choice.</body></html>
