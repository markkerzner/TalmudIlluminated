commandment that is dependent on the land applies only in the Land of
Israel, and every commandment that is not dependent on the land applies
both in the Land of Israel and outside the Land, except for the
commandments of Orlah (prohibiting first 3 years of tree's fruit) and
forbidden mixtures of planting.<br><br>Then why in connection with the
Mitzva of Tefillin does the Torah say "And it will come to pass when
God brings you to the Land of Canaanaties...?" - It means to say,
"Perform this commandment, for on account of it you will merit to enter
the Land."
