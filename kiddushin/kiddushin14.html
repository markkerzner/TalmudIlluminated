Why?<br><ol><li>Husband
caused the prohibition, and he also removes it? No, because she is
still forbidden to marry his son from the previous marriage or his
father.</li><li>A widow is forbidden to the Chief Priest, so she must
be allowed to marry everyone else? No, perhaps she would still be
transgressing a positive commandment.</li><li>When Jewish soldiers went
to war, &#8220;And whichever man betrothed a wife and did not yet take her,
let him return, lest he dies in battle and another man takes her&#8221; - is
a valid proof.</li></ol></body></html>
