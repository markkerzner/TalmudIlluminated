Yannai wore the golden plate of the High Priest, and one sage protested that Yannai was an unfit Kohen. Elazar suggested to kill all sages. But what of the Torah? - Here it is in the corner, anybody who wants can learn! Yannai executed the sages. Why was Yannai fit? The witnesses to his unfitness were later established as false witnesses.</body></html>
