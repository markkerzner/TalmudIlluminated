<br />
From where do we know that her offspring is non-Jewish like her? - "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/7-4.htm">For he will turn your son away from Me and they will serve other gods.</a>"  Thus your grandson who comes from your Jewish daughter is called your son but your grandson who comes from a heathen woman is not called your son, rather, he is considered her son.
