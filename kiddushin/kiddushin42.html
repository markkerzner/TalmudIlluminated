orphans who are minors come before the court to divide the assets of
their deceased father, the court appoints an administrator for each of
them, just as leaders of the tribes divided the land between the Jews
entering Israel.<br><br>When the orphans become adults, they cannot
protest the settlement, for if they indeed had such a right, what worth
is there in the power of the court?<br><br>Brothers who divide an
inheritance are like purchasers of their respective shares.
Consequently, if they erred estimating the value and the discrepancy is
more than a sixth, the transaction is void.
