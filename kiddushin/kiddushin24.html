Canaanite slave goes free if someone gives money to his master on the
condition that the slave should be free. Another way is to to give
money to the slave on condition that he can use it to free himself.<br><br>If
a Canaanite slave was already circumcised and immersed in a Mikveh, and
the master knocks out his tooth, takes out his eye, or inflicts damage
on any of 22 other extremities, the slave goes free, and the courts
force his master to write a document of emancipation for him.
