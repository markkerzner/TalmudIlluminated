Another way is to to give money to the slave on condition that he can use it to free himself.<br />
<br />
If a Canaanite slave was already circumcised and immersed in a Mikveh, and the master knocks out his tooth, takes out his eye, or inflicts damage on any of 22 other extremities, the slave goes free, and the courts force his master to write a document of emancipation for him.
