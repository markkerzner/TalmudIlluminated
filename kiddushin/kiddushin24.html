type of slave designated as &#8220;Canaanite slave&#8221; is acquired with money
and is the property of its owner. Nevertheless, if the master knocks
out the slave&#8217;s tooth or destroys his eye, whether by accident or on
purpose, the slave acquires freedom. Moreover, if the master destroys
&#8220;a tip of the slave&#8217;s limb that does not regenerate,&#8221; the slaves also
goes free. There are twenty four such &#8220;tips&#8221;: ten fingers, ten toes,
two ears, the nose and the male member. How do we know this? <a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=21#P2101">Only the eye and tooth are mentioned in the Torah</a>!? <br>
<br>
Well, easy: what is common between an eye and a tooth? The fact that
they are exposed to view and they do not regenerate! &#8211; Therefore, we
will include any other organ that is exposed to view and that does not
regenerate, and these are the twenty-four mentioned above.<br>
<br>
But we can suggest a counterargument: why do we need to mention a tooth
after an eye was mentioned? The eye is in the open, and it does not
regenerate. So the eye alone could teach me the lesson, and I would
know that a slave goes free when the master knocks out his tooth. If
so, why was the tooth mentioned? &#8211; To limit freedom to only these two
cases!<br>
<br>
We can argue back: if only the tooth was mentioned, then I would
include even the milk tooth. How do I know that a slave does not go
free in this case? &#8211; By comparison with an eye, which does not
regenerate. <br>
<br>
Okay, but then the Torah should have written just the eye! &#8211; No, for if
it did, I would not include the tooth, since the tooth is not present
at birth. Thus, both had to be mentioned, and the other members are
learned from them.<br>
