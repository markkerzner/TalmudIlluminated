In court, the master bores his ear against the door with an awl, as an act of acquisition. <br/> <br/> A Hebrew servant should be given food and wine better than his master's, and a better bed, because the Torah says, "it is good for him with you." The master also supports the servant's wife and children that the servant had before his servitude. <br/> <br/></body></html>
