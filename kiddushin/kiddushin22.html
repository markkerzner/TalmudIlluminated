Hebrew servant who likes life with his master and with his Canaanite
slave-woman mate may stay with his master "forever," if he insists on
it, which practically means until the Jubilee year. In court, the
master bores his ear against the door with an awl, as an act of
acquisition.<br><br>A Hebrew servant should be given food and wine
better than his master's, and a better bed, because the Torah says, "it
is good for him with you." The master also supports the servant's wife
and children that the servant had before his servitude.</p></div></body></html>
