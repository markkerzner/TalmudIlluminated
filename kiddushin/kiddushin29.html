father's obligations what involve his son are: to circumcise him, to
redeem him if he is a firstborn (by paying fives coins to a Kohen), to
teach him Torah, to take a wife for him (that is, to help him find a
wife and assist him in preparations for marriage) and to teach him a
craft. Some say, father is obligated teach him to swim in water.<br><br>Rabbi
Yehudah says, &#8220;Anyone who does not teach his son a craft has taught him
banditry. Talmud: &#8220;Can you really think so? - Rather, as if the father
taught him banditry.&#8221;
