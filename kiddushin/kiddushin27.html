The land may even be sold to one person, while the gift of movables goes to the other. <br/> <br/> In all these cases complete money payment must be made before the movables are acquired. <br/> <br/> "Devolving of oath" happens when the Torah requires an oath for one item and a related item requires an oath by devolving.</body></html>
