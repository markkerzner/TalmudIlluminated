a man says to a woman: "Become betrothed to me with this cup of wine,"
and the cup was found to contain honey, or the other way around - she
is not betrothed. Some people prefer wine, and some prefer honey.<br><br>Or,
if a man asks a woman to become betrothed with a silver coin, and it
was found to be made of gold, or the other way around - she is not
betrothed. In some situations, she may need silver and in some gold.<br><br>Ten measures of conversation descended to the world, and women took nine of them.
