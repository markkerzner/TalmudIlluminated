a man says to a woman: &#8220;Become betrothed to me on condition that my
father does not protest,&#8221; and the father dies without protesting, the
woman is betrothed. If the son dies, the father should protest, so that
the woman avoids levirate marriage.<br><br>If the father of a girl
declared: &#8220;I gave my daughter in betrothal but I do not know to whom&#8221;
and a man came and said &#8220;I am the one,&#8221; he is believed. If two man
came, both of them give a Get, and if they wish, one of them gives a
Get and the other one marries her.</body></html>
