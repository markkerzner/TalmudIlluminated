If the son dies, the father should protest, so that the woman avoids levirate marriage.<br />
<br />
If the father of a girl declared: "I gave my daughter in betrothal but I do not know to whom" and a man  came and said "I am the one," he is believed. If two man came, both of them give a Get, and if they wish, one of them gives a Get and the other one marries her.
