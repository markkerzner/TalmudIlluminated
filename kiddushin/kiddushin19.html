man who has bought a Hebrew maidservant can designate her as his wife,
without the need for Kiddushin money, but with her knowledge. Can he do
this for his son who is a minor? Does the phrase &#8220;or to his son&#8221; mean
that the son can be any age or that he has to be like his father, an
adult?<br><br>Answer: while a nine-year old CAN acquire a wife in
levirate marriage if his brother dies by having marital relations with
her, designation of a maidservant as a wife is not possible until the
son is an adult.
