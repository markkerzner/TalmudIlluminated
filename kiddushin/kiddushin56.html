with hair of a nazirite, with a firstborn male of a donkey, with
mixture of meat cooked with milk, with an unconsecrated animal
slaughtered in the Temple Courtyard, she is not betrothed.<br><br>However, if he transgressed and sold any of these items, and betrothed her with their payment, she is betrothed.
