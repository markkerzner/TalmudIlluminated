Akiva was accustomed to scoff at sinners, because he felt that it is a
simple matter to overcome the temptations of the Evil Inclination, if
only one desires to do so.<br><br>One day Satan appeared to him
disguised as a woman, perched atop a palm tree. Rabbi Akiva began to
climb to meet "her". When he reached the middle, Satan released him
from his grip and said: "Had they not proclaimed in Heaven - 'Be
cautious of Rabbi Akiva and his Torah,' - I would have made your life
worthless."<br><br>Students of Shmuel were careful not to be alone with an animal, but this is normally not required.
