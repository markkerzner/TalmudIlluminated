<br />
One day Satan appeared to him disguised as a woman, perched atop a palm tree. Rabbi Akiva began to climb to meet "her". When he reached the middle, Satan released him from his grip and said: "Had they not proclaimed in Heaven - 'Be cautious of Rabbi Akiva and his Torah,' - I would have made your life worthless."<br />
