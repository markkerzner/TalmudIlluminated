The Kiddushin is effected when the man gives the document to the woman. <br/> <br/> Why does this work? Because "And she will leave the first husband's house, and she will go and be a wife unto another man." Since " leave " can be effected through a document, so too " be " can be effected through a document. <br/> <br/> But if so, can divorce be effected with money? - No, because a defender cannot become an accuser. And while the documents would be different and distinct, money would be the same.</body></html>
