The Kiddushin is effected when the man gives the document to the woman.<br />
<br />
Why? Because "And she will <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">leave</span> the first husband's house, and she will go and <span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">be</span> a wife unto another man." Since "<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">leave</span>" can be effected through a document, so too "<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">be</span>" can be effected through a document.<br />
<br />
