Kohen who wishes to marry a daughter of a Kohen must examine the status
of her ancestors: her mother and the mother of her mother, the mother
of her mother's father and <span style="font-style: italic;">her</span> mother, the mother of her father and <span style="font-style: italic;">her</span> mother, the mother of her father's father and <span style="font-style: italic;">her</span> mother - but only if there is some evidence of a blemish.<br><br>If
in that line he finds a Kohen who served at the Altar, or a member of
the Sanhedrin, or a public official, or a charity collector, the
investigation stops. The latter two are often involved in quarrels, so
any blemish in their genealogy is already known.
