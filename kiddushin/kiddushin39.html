(prohibition of the first 3 years of tree's fruit) reads as follows: in
Israel it is forbidden, if in doubt, it is also forbidden. Outside of
Israel one can go to the field where the Orlah tree grows and buy the
fruit, provided that one does not see it being picked.<br><br>One who
performs an extra mitzvah is getting the goodness of performing another
mitzvah, and his life is extended to do it. Thus, the reward for a
mitzvah is only another mitzvah, except for respect for the parents and
sending away the mother bird, for which long life is promised..
