A woman can accept kiddushin and become betrothed either personally or through her agent. A man may give his daughter in betrothal when she is a na'arah (under 12) either personally or through his agent. Performing betrothal as well as any other mitzvah personally is the preferred way.<br />
<br />
From where in the Torah do we derive the legal concept of agency? From its use of "and he sends her" instead of a more direct "and he divorces" we learn that both man and woman can appoint an agent.
