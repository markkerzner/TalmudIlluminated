man can betroth a woman either personally or through his agent. A woman
can accept kiddushin and become betrothed either personally or through
her agent. A man may give his daughter in betrothal when she is a
na'arah (under 12) either personally or through his agent. Performing
betrothal as well as any other mitzvah personally is the preferred way.<br><br>From
where in the Torah do we derive the legal concept of agency? From its
use of "and he sends her" instead of a more direct "and he divorces" we
learn that both man and woman can appoint an agent.
