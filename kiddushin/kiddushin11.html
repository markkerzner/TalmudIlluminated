Shammai required for Kiddushin a minimum of a dinar, a coin with silver
content equivalent to 96 grains of barley. What is their reason?<br><br>Self-esteem? - No, because then some would require more.<br><br>Is it because when Torah mentions Kesef (money), it means a silver coin? This withstands questioning.<br><br>Or
is it because we compare a bride to a Jewish maidservant, who is
redeemed by diminishing the price for years served, so she needs to
start out with a dinar? This also withstands questioning.<br><br>The law follows Beit Hillel who require only a minimal coin (prutah, about 5 cents).
