What is their reason?<br />
<br />
Self-esteem? - No, because then some would require more.<br />
<br />
Is it because when Torah mentions Kesef (money), it means a silver coin? This withstands questioning.<br />
<br />
Or is it because we compare a bride to a Jewish maidservant, who is redeemed by diminishing the price for years served, so she needs to start out with a dinar? This also withstands questioning.<br />
<br />
The law follows Beit Hillel who require only a minimal coin (prutah, about 5 cents).
