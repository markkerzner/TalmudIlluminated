Unexpressed intentions are not recognized in Jewish law. <br/> <br/> If one betroths a woman and her sister simultaneously, neither is betrothed. <br/> <br/> There were five women, two of whom were sisters, and a man collected a basket of their figs and said, "You are all betrothed to me with this basket," - the sisters were not betrothed.</body></html>
