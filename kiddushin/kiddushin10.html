ten man anally cohabited with a betrothed virgin, she is still
considered a virgin, and all ten are liable to stoning. If her groom
does this, she is not a virgin.<br><br>In Kiddushin through copulation
(not encouraged), does the initial stage or the complete penetration
effect acquisition? Although adultery is committed at the initial
stage, in Kiddushin the man's intention is for complete penetration,
which therefore effects the acquisition.<br><br>Cohabitation for the
sake of betrothal effects only the first stage of marriage, Kiddushin.
The couple still needs the second stage (Huppah), formally bringing the
wife into the husband's domain.</body></html>
