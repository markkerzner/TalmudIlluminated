<br />
Rava: "When a man shall take a wife and cohabit with her..." teaches my rule.<br />
<br />
Abaye: If a man betroths one of two sisters, and does not know which, she is betrothed but due to not knowing which one is his wife, he needs to give a Get to both. According to Rava, Kiddushin should not even take effect!<br />
<br />
Rava answers: The man knew whom he betrothed, thus the Kiddushin took effect, and then they intermingled.<br />
