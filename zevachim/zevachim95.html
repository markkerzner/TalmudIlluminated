If it has meanwhile become ritually impure, it must be ripped to loose its impurity, then brought back and laundered. <br/> <br/> Similar law applies to an earthenware utensil, except that if it becomes impure while outside, it cannot be broken - since breaking must be inside. Instead, one punctures a small hole in it, which makes it unusable and leads it to loose its impurity, then brings it into the Courtyard and breaks it there. <br/> <br/> Resh Lakish asked a question - What happens if the robe of the High Priest was spattered with blood, taken outside the Courtyard, and there it became impure. The advice above cannot be applied, because <a href = "null">it is forbidden to tear this robe</a> . It needs to be brought inside and laundered there, but it is forbidden to do so, because it is impure. One is also not allowed to dip it in a mikva to remove its impurity - because that would be the beginning of washing, and washing can only be done inside the Courtyard.
