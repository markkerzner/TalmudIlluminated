<br />
The thanksgiving offering is holy, but not the most holy: it can be slaughtered anywhere in the Courtyard, it may be eaten anywhere in Jerusalem, by any person, for the day of the offering and the following night. Special portions of it are given to the kohanim and their families.<br />
<br />
Peace offerings are similar holy offerings, but can be eaten for an additional day.<br />
