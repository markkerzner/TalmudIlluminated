However, if one sacrifices an animal with a temporarily blemish, then Rabbi Shimon says that he violates a negative commandment and is liable to lashes, but the Sages consider him completely exempt.<br />
<br />
The reason of the Sages is clear - a temporarily blemished animal cannot be currently brought "before God," but what is the reason of Rabbi Shimon? - He bases his opinion on the phrase, "<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/12-8.htm">You shall not do everything we do today, each man what is proper in his eyes</a>." The word "proper" means "proper in the eyes of the man who offers" now, and will become so in the eyes of God later - and it is this action that "you shall not do."<br />
