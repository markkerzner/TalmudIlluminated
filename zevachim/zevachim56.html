In order to make the whole area of the Courtyard "in front," there were additional doors, on the opposite far sides of the Hall, leading into the Hall. <br/> <br/> The blood of the sacrifices had to be offered before sunset. After sunset it became disqualified, because of the verse " <a href = "http://bible.cc/leviticus/7-16.htm">on the day that he offers his sacrifice it shall be eaten</a> ." This teaches that both the slaughter and the offering of the blood must occur on the same day. <br/> <br/> Art: Charles Théodore Frère - Sunset On The Nile</body></html>
