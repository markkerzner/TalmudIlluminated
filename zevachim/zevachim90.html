Just as they precede in offering, so they precede in consumption.<br />
<br />
If we have a peace offering from yesterday and a sin-offering from today, then the peace offering should be eaten first, because it would an expression of disdain to allow yesterday's offerings to spoil - this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir, but the Sages maintain that the regular rule of "more sacred comes first" still applies even here.<br />
<br />
For consumption, the Kohanim are allowed to cook the offerings in any way they like, to roast, boil, or fry them, and to add any spices.<br />
<br />
Which comes first, more frequent or more sacred? Let's prove it from the additional Shabbat offering itself: it is more sacred, and nevertheless the more frequent daily offerings comes before it! - No, that is no proof, because </span><span style="font-size: medium;" class="Apple-style-span">on Shabbat </span><span style="font-size: medium;" class="Apple-style-span">the daily offering is also more special. After making five more attempts to find a proof, the Talmud leaves this unresolved.<br />
