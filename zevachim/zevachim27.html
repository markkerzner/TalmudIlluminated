<br />
There are many ways to understand this rule. Shmuel said that although the sacrifice is invalid, its owners still receive atonement, based on the phrase, "And I gave you and Altar for atonement", implying all of the Altar. But one may ask that if so, the meat should also be eaten! - Shmuel understands "For atonement" only, not for other purposes.<br />
<br />
Resh Lakish agrees with Shmuel if the Kohen applied the blood silently, but if he announced a wrong intent, it is completely invalid. Still, it does not qualify for being cut off.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yochanan says that applying the blood in the wrong place does not count at all.<br />
