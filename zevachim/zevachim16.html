Only the priests who are the descendants of Aharon can serve in the Temple. The Torah said, " <a href = "null">Speak to Aaron and to his sons that they shall separate themselves from the holies of the children of Israel and they shall not profane</a> ..." <br/> <br/> A kohen whose relative, one of the seven close ones - father, mother, brother, unmarried sister, son, daughter, or spouse - has died this day. Since Aharon was specifically requested to continue the service after his two sons died, " <a href = "null">And he need not leave the Sanctuary and he will not profane</a> ...", we understand that all other Kohanim would profane the service. <br/> <br/> Although the ruling above mentions only receiving the blood, the same disqualification also applies to the other two steps - carrying the blood and throwing it on the Altar. The slaughter, however, is valid if done by a non-Kohen, since the Torah said, "And he slaughters, and a Kohen receives the blood." <br/> <br/> Art: Pierre Auguste Renoir - The Artists Family <br/></body></html>
