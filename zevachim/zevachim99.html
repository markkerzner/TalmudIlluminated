A kohen who is a mourner is allowed to touch sacrifices - he does not make them ritually impure - but he cannot offer them, and he does not have a claim to a share to eat that night. <br/> <br/> A kohen who has a blemish, whether passing or permanent, does have a share in the offerings and is allowed to eat them, but cannot offer them or do any kind of sacrificial service. <br/> <br/> Any kohen who was disqualified at any point of the service - for example, if he was impure when the blood was thrown but later, when the fats were burned, he became pure - does not have a share in that offering. And one who does not have a share in the meat does not have a share in the hides. This is derived from the Torah phrase " The one from the among the sons of Aharon who offers (that is, who is fit to offer) the blood of the peace offering and the fat - the right thigh shall be his portion ." <br/> <br/> Art: Georges de La Tour - Dying Monk</body></html>
