<br />
If the blood of a sin-offering spattered on a hide, then if the hide was not yet stripped from the animal, it does not require washing (because it cannot be a garment yet), but if it was stripped from the animal, then it does require washing (because the skin can be designated for use as a mat by the owner in his mind) - these are the words of Rabbi Yehudah. However, Rabbi Elazar says that until it becomes a garment, and is not merely designated for use, it cannot accept ritual impurity and thus does not require washing.<br />
<br />
Only the place of the blood requires laundering, and it must be done in the Courtyard. So too must the  earthenware be shattered in the Courtyard. Thus laundering is a stringency possessed by the sin-offering over other most holy offerings. <br />
