The Torah said, " <a href = "null">And any person who will eat an animal that died by itself or was torn... - he shall immerse his garments and immerse himself in the water and remain impure until evening and then be pure</a> ." <br/> <br/> <br/> Furthermore, the Oral Law tells us that this verse is talking only about birds, and not about any animals. As an exception, we have previously learned that <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/zevachim/zevachim68.html">if a bird has a <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/zevachim/zevachim68.html">melikah</a> applied to it, even in the wrong way - it may not have the law of a bird who died by itself</a> . <br/> <br/> What if the Kohen did a melikah to the bird and then it was found to be a "trefah," - possessing a defect that would surely cause its death anyway? Rabbi Meir says that it does not contaminate, and Rabbi Yehudah says that it does. <br/> <br/> Rabbi Meir proves his points of view by comparing with the slaughter of an animal - whose impurity is more strict, and nevertheless the slaughter purifies it - and the same should be true for birds. <br/> <br/> Art: Pieter the Elder Bruegel - Winter Landscape with Skaters and a Bird Trap (detail)</body></html>
