One is also not liable for actions that are not the last step in the service, thus, for example, one is not liable for separating a handful from the flour-offering, but is liable for burning it. Likewise, one is not liable for receiving the blood, but is liable for throwing it on the altar. <br/> <br/> Initially sacrificial service was done by the firstborn, and everybody was allowed to build his private altar. This is mentioned in the Torah when it says, " <a href = "http://bible.cc/exodus/24-5.htm">And Moses sent the youths of the Children of Israel, and they brought up burnt offerings</a> ." The firstborn lost this privilege after they worshipped the Golden Calf, and the kohanim, the sons of Aaron, began to serve in their stead. <br/> <br/> Once the Tabernacle was erected, private altars became forbidden. When the Jews came Israel, crossed the Jordan, and erected the Tabernacle at Gilgal, near Jericho, private altars again became permitted. F inally, t hey became completely prohibited after the building of the Temple in Jerusalem. <br/> <br/> Art: Johann Wilhelm Schirmer - The Departure Of The Man To Jericho Morning C.1856</body></html>
