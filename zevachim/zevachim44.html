However, how do we know that? The Torah only hints at this law, and even that only in the context of peace-offering. <br/> <br/> Here is the relevant passage, " <a href = "null">If some of the meat-offering of his peace-offering will be consumed at all on the third day...it shall be rejected</a> " and the person who eats it will be cut off from the people. <br/> <br/> We have <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/zevachim/zevachim29.html">already learned that this verse is talking about the intention to eat on the third day, not the real eating on the third day</a> - since the meat becomes rejected right away, which can only happen as a result of his intention. <br/> <br/> However, how do we know that this law equally applies to other sacrifices, and not only to those that are similar to peace-offering, which would include just first-born and tithe? - From the extra word "of the meat" we learn that it applies to all sacrifices that are eaten. What about sacrifices that are not eaten, like the burnt-offering? - This is learned from the extra "offering" in the word combination "meat-offering." <br/> <br/> Art: Frederick Daniel Hardy - First-Born</body></html>
