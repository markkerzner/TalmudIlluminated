<br />
What is their argument? Rabbi Eliezer's line of reasoning is this. As soon as the owner consecrated the bird as a burnt-offering, it became Temple property, subject to the law of misappropriation. It never lost this status, and thus is forbidden to use.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Yehoshua, on the other hand, says that if the Kohen changed the burnt-offering with regard to designation, procedure, and location, and did all as if it were a sin-offering, it became transformed into a sin-offering, at least as far as the law of misappropriation is concerned, and there is no punishment for its misuse. Rabbi Yehoshua agrees that the Kohen still should not eat it.<br />
