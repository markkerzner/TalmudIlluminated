though one said the Shema in the synagogue during the evening prayer,
it is still a mitzvah to recite it again before going to sleep. Why?
The psalm says, &#8220;Reflect in your hearts while on your beds, and then be
silent.&#8221; Resh Lakish sees another lesson here: a man should constantly
agitate his good thoughts against the bad ones (&#8220;Agitate and don't
sin&#8221;); if he removes the bad, good, but if not &#8211; let him study Torah
(&#8220;reflect in your hearts&#8221;); if he wins, good, if not &#8211; let him say the
Shema (&#8220;on your beds&#8221;); if that does not help, he should remind himself
of the day of death (&#8220;be silent&#8221;).

<br>
Rabbi Zeira said, &#8220;Look how the Holy One Blessed Be He is not like a
person of flesh and blood. If a person sells a cherished object to
another, he is sad, and the buyer is happy. But the Holy One Blessed Be
He gave the Torah to Israel and He rejoiced, saying 'For I have given
you a good doctrine, do not abandon My Torah.'&#8221;
<br>

<br>
If a person sees afflictions befalling him, he should investigate his
deeds, since the nature of the affliction may have a hint for him. If
he examined his deeds and did not find anything, he should attribute it
to neglect of Torah study, based on the phrase &#8220;Fortunate is the man
whom God afflicts, and whom You teach from Your Torah.&#8221; If he did not
find that either, they are &#8220;afflictions of love,&#8221; since &#8220;For God
rebukes the one He loves.&#8221;
