that Rabban Gamliel allows the Shema to be said till morning, while the
Sages limit it at midnight. It once happened that the sons of Rabban
Gamliel returned from a feast past midnight, and they have not yet said
the Shema. They asked their father: &#8220;Can we still say the prayer?&#8221; He
told them, &#8220;Yes. The Sages agree to me in principle, only they wanted
to distance a man from a mistake. Also, for example, offerings that are
eaten for one day can be eaten all night, but the Sages limited it till
midnight.&#8221;
<br>

<br>
He did not mention the Passover offering as such an example! This must
mean that Rabban Gamliel takes sides in another disagreement, about a
Passover offering. Here it is: Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria says that the
Passover offering can be eaten only until midnight, but Rabbi Akiva
says that it can be eaten till morning. What are their proofs? Rabbi
Elazar bases his on the phrase "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=12#P1825">They will eat the meat on this night</a>,"
and since when God passed through Egypt, it was also "this night," and
meant midnight, then here too, the eating is only until midnight. And
Rabbi Akiva? He says, "It means, this night, but not the next night.
For otherwise you might have though that the Passover offering is eaten
for a night, a day, and a following night, and 'This night' excludes
this possibility."<br>

<br>
But what is the root cause of their disagreement? They argue about the
word, "in haste," to whom it applies. If to Jews, then their haste was
in the morning, and if to Egyptians, to send the Jews out, then this
haste&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;at midnight.
