Who was it for, for a healthy person or even for a somewhat weak one? Was it for the one who had accidental emission, or also for one who experienced it at will, as a result of his marital relations? Also, the nine kavin vessel above, who was that for? - which combination of the factors allowed or even required it? <br/> <br/> Finally, even though some individuals continued to practice it, the custom has become not to require the additional purification in the mikveh, following the opinion of Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira. Here is how we know it. One student (who had an emission) was reciting Torah teachings in front of Rabbi Yehudah and was stammering. Rabbi Yehudah told him, "My son! Open your mouth and let your words shine forth!" As Jeremeiah said, "Behold, My words are like fire, says God." Just as fire cannot contract impurity, so words of Torah cannot contract impurity. <br/> <br/> Art: Antonio Rotta - Student Dreamer</body></html>
