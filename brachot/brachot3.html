or &#8220;the first watch.&#8221; Why did he use this expression? &#8211; He wanted to
tell us that there are &#8220;watches in heaven&#8221; and there are also &#8220;watches
on earth,&#8221; that is, there are spiritual changes during the night, which
are reflected in propitious prayer and study times. At each and every
watch the Holy One Blessed Be He sits and roars like a lion, as
Jeremiah has said, &#8220;God will roar from on high... He will roar and roar
over his lodging.&#8221; <br>

<br>
At the first watch a donkey brays, at the second &#8211; dogs howl, at the
third &#8211; and infant nurses from his mother's breasts, and a woman talks
to her husband. But why do we need these signs? We know when it is
morning anyway? &#8211; If one is sleeping in a dark house, once a woman
begins speaking with her husband &#8211; let his arise and say the Shema.

Rabbi Yose told a story. I once traveled on the road and entered a ruin
of Jerusalem to pray. Elijah came and waited for me at the entrance.
When I finished my prayer, he told me, &#8220;You should have prayed on the
road.&#8221; I learned then that one should not enter a ruin, and that one
can pray a short prayer while on the road. He then asked, &#8220;What did you
hear, my son?&#8221; I told him, &#8220;I heard a Heavenly voice that was cooing
like a dove and saying, 'Woe to the sons because of whose sins I
destroyed My house, burned my Temple, and exiled them among the nations
of the world.'&#8221; Elijah told me &#8220;God says this not once but three times
every day. And when the people enter synagogues and houses of study,
the Holy One Blessed Be he shakes His head and says, 'Fortunate is the
King who is praised in His house thus, what is there for the Father who
exiled His sons, and woe to the sons who have been exiled from the
Father's table.&#8221;
