is derived from King David's words, &#8220;At midnight I will rise to give
You thanks.&#8221; Since David also said, &#8220;My eyes preceded the watches,&#8221; we
see that there are still two watches left at midnight. However, David's
real schedule was as follows: during the first part of the night he
would sleep like a horse, whose sleep is always light &#8211; that is, he
would study Torah with occasional catnaps, and since midnight he arose
strong as a lion, to sing praises. For that, David had a harp near his
bed, and at midnight the northern wind would come and play on it, to
wake him up.
<br>

<br>
David praised himself, &#8220;Guard my soul, for I am devout.&#8221; He meant, &#8220;All
the kings of East and West sleep until three hours into the day, but I
arise at midnight, to give thanks to You.&#8221; Some say, he meant, &#8220;All
kings sit with honorable advisors, and my hands are soiled with blood,
looking at the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/06/niddah-and-zavah-cycles.html">niddah</a>
stains, embryos, and afterbirths, to declare a woman pure for her
husband. Not only that, but I will agree if my decision is incorrect.&#8221;
<br>

<br>

The Sages <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">required saying the Shema before midnight</a>.&nbsp;Why?
This is later than people going to bed, but earlier than the sleep
ends! &#8211; They wanted to distance a man from an error, lest he comes home
and decides to eat a little and sleep a little, and then miss the
evening Shema, and anybody who transgresses the words of the Sages
deserves to be bitten by a snake. Why suddenly so strong a statement?
Because of the danger of sleep. <br>
