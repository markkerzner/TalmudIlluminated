<html><title>Brachot 15 - Proper Way</title><body>Brachot 15 - Proper Way<br/><br/><img src="../images/Jan+Lievens+-+Washing+The+Hands.jpg"/>Rabbi Yochanan taught: "One who wishes to accept on himself Heaven's sovereignty in a complete manner, should relieve himself and wash his hands, don tefillin, then say the <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html"><a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a></a> , and the Amidah (Standing) prayer - and this is complete acceptance." <br/> <br/> If one said the <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html"><a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a></a> , but did not make it audible to his ears - this not the perfect way, but it counts. Rabbi Yose disagrees and says that he has not fulfilled his obligation and will have to repeat the <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html"><a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a></a>. What is the argument? Rabbi Yose says that the word "<a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html"><a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a></a>" itself, which means "Hear" teaches that one should hear his words. And the first teacher (usually it is Rabbi Meir), what does he say? He says, "<a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html"><a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a></a>," or "Hear" means "Understand" and tells us that one can say the <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html"><a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a></a> in any language that he understands. And Rabbi Yose? He surelly agrees that one can say the <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html"><a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a></a> in any language!? - He says that the word "<a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html"><a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a></a>" actually carries both lessons: that one must hear his words and that one can recite the <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html"><a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/08/brachot-2-saying-shema-prayer.html">Shema</a></a> in any language that he understands. <br/> <br/> Art: Jan Lievens - Washing the hands</body></html>
