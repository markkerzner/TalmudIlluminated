Rabbi Yose disagrees and says that he has not fulfilled his obligation and will have to repeat the Shema. What is the argument? Rabbi Yose says that the word "Shema" itself, which means "Hear" teaches that one should hear his words. And the first teacher (usually it is Rabbi Meir), what does he say? He says, "Shema," or "Hear" means "Understand" and tells us that one can say the Shema in any language that he understands. And Rabbi Yose? He surelly agrees that one can say the Shema in any language!? - He says that the word "Shema" actually carries both lessons: that one must hear his words and that one can recite the Shema in any language that he understands. <br/> <br/> Art: Jan Lievens - Washing the hands</body></html>
