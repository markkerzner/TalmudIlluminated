<span style="font-weight: bold;">Brachot 11 &#8211; Lying Down to Say the Shema</span><br>
<br>
Bait Shammai say that in the evening one must lie down in order to read
the Shema, and in the morning he needs to be standing, since the Torah
said, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=6#P5088">When you lie down and when you arise</a>.&#8221; &nbsp;However, Beit Hillel say that one can say the Shema in any position he finds himself, since the Torah also said, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=5&amp;CHAPTER=6#P5088">While you go on the way</a>,&#8221;
and that is neither lying down nor standing up. How does Beit Hillel
explain &#8220;when you lie down and when you arise?&#8221; They say, it is talking
about the time when people lie down and arise, not about the physical
position. And Beit Shammai, how do they know the times to say the
Shema? They answer, the Torah said, &#8220;When you lie down,&#8221; and not &#8220;when
lying down&#8221; to tell us both the time and the position.
<br>

<br>
Rabbi Tarfon said, &#8220;I was once on the road, and when the time for the
evening Shema came, I lay down, to fulfill the words of Beit Shammai,
and I almost came in danger because of the robbers.&#8221; His colleagues
told him, &#8220;It would have been your own fault, for transgressing the
words of Beit Hillel.&#8221;
<br>

<br>
The morning Shema is accompanied by two blessing before it and one
after. These are thanks for giving the Torah and for help in studying
it, as well as thanks and requests for God's help in all other areas.
In parallel, the evening Shema has two blessings before and two
blessings after it.<br>
