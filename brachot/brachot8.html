Itzchak said to Rav Nachman, &#8220;Why does the master (Rav Nachman) not
come to the synagogue to pray?&#8221; Rav Nachman answered, &#8220;I feel weak.&#8221; -
&#8220;Then assemble ten people to pray with you!&#8221; - &#8220;I don't want to trouble
them.&#8221; - &#8220;Then ask a messenger to come and inform you when they pray.&#8221;
Finally, Rav Nachman asked, &#8220;What is the significance of all these
questions?&#8221; Rav Itzchak answered, &#8220;Because it is a favorable time,&#8221; as
in &#8220;<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2669.htm">but for me, my prayer to God is at the favorable time</a>,&#8221;
and what is this &#8211; when the congregation prays. Anyone who has a
synagogues in his city and does not go there to pray is called an evil
neighbor. <br>

<br>

The phrase &#8220;<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2632.htm">Pray to God when He is (easily) found</a>&#8221;
can also be understood as &#8220;Pray to God when you need to find
(something).&#8221; What is this something one should pray for? &#8211; A good
wife, as Solomon said, &#8220;One who found a wife found goodness.&#8221; Some say,
this is Torah, about which Solomon said &#8220;He who find me finds life.&#8221;
And some say, easy death when his time comes. The hardest death is
similar to pulling branches of thorns from a ball of wool shearings,
and the easiest is like removing a hair from milk.

Rava asked Rafram bar Pappa, "Tell us some of the great things that Rav Chisda said about a synagogue." Rafram answered: &#8220;<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2687.htm">God loves the places where they study the Torah more than all the sanctuaries of Jacob (synagogues)</a>&#8221;
- that is, God loves places of practical study of the law more than all
synagogues. Then how is this a great thing about synagogues? - It is,
because, synagogues God He loves next, right after study halls.<br>
