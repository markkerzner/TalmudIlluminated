This is true even if the food they ate had some limitations. For example, in the case of food from which tithes may not have been separated - still, since one can renounce all his possessions, become poor, and be free of the obligation to tithe. <br/> <br/> This joining in prayer removes the obstacles on the way of the prayer and allows it to rise up; and also brings an additional level of joy. What is the source for it? - It is this phrase: " <a href = "null">When I proclaim God's name, praise God for His greatness</a> ." <br/> <br/> Art: Gillis Van Tilborch - Elegant company at a table on a terrace</body></html>
