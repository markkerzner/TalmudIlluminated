They disagree about when does morning end. In view of their positions, who could have authored the following rule (remember, we don't want to introduce a third view unless absolutely necessary). 
<br />
<br />
The Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=16#P1969">When the sun grew hot, the manna would melt</a>." - and that is the fourth hour! Now, you say it is the forth hour, but may not, maybe it is midday?! - No, midday is called "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=18#P426">The heat of the day</a>." So who is the author? Not Rabbi Yehudah, who considers all four hours as morning, and surely not the Sages, who consider all six hours morning!? If you want, I can tell you that this rule agrees with the Sages, and if you want - with Rabbi Yehudah. How so? With the Sages: since the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=16#P1969">Morning, every morning</a>," it really meant the first part of the morning, that is, three hours, just as we said. Or with Rabbi Yehudah: "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=16#P1969">Morning, every morning</a>" means one hour before the end of morning, that is, one hour before four, which is three.
