Rav Chisda answered him, "My God! Even if Rabbi Yochanan himself told me this, I would not listen to him." Rather he should pause. If he did not, the verse from Ezekiel applies to him, "I (God) too gave you decrees that were not good" - since he denied the goodness contained in Shema. If he did stop, however, his reward is in the verse " <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=32#P5800">And with this matter (or speech) shall you prolong your days</a> ." <br/> <br/> If one's hand is resting in the airspace of a latrine, can he say the Shema then? Rav Huna says that he is permitted, relying on the verse in the psalms, " <a href = "http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26f0.htm">All that breathe shall praise God</a> " - that is, only the position of his nose and mouth matters. However Rav Chisda forbids it, based on a different verse, "All my limbs shall exclaim, ' <a href = "http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2635.htm">God, who is like You!</a> '" <br/> <br/> Art: David The Younger Teniers - The Five Senses Series- Smelling</body></html>
