However, because it is was not exactly known when the court will establish the first of the month (which was based on seeing the moon), Rosh HaShanah was celebrated for two days since very long ago. This is still true today, whether in Israel or outside. What does one say in prayer? <br/> <br/> Rabbi Dosa says that one makes his prayer conditional: "Strengthen us on this new moon which is Rosh Hashanah, whether it is today or tomorrow." On the next day, he adds, "Whether it is today or was yesterday." If one does not phrase his prayer this way, it will contain a false statement. However, the Sages do not agree, saying that if you phrase your prayers conditionally, then the people will treat the holiday lightly and may do work on it. <br/> <br/> Rabbi Dosa disagrees with the Sages on many points, and the Talmud enumerates them, adding that all of them had to be told. Otherwise, we might have though that the fear of treating the day lightly applies only on Rosh HaShanah, when people might transgress by doing work; by contrast, on the new moon work is permitted, so this prayer could be conditional - we are told that the Sages disagree here also, and require one form of prayer, without conditions. <br/> <br/> Art: Francis Augustus Silva - Moonrise on the New England Coast</body></html>
