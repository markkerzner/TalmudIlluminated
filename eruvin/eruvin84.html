The residents of the upper floor ascend there through a staircase, and there is a balcony, or "gallery" at the second floor. They constitute two different courtyards: the residents living on each level have to make their own eruv (common food) in order to carry on their level on Shabbat. 
<br />
<br />
In addition, they need to make a common eruv between the two floors, something that we previously called the eruv of the alley. What happens when they forget to make the common eruv? - The residents of the upper floor can carry there and in all adjoining areas, and so too the residents of the lower level. Should the residents of the upper floor forget their own eruv, they prohibit carrying not only on their floor, but also on the lower one in the courtyard, because they have the right to go through this courtyard, and they bring with them the limitation that they themselves have.<br />
<br />
Which area is considered adjoining to the second level? Any that has the height of ten hand-breadths and which is in addition is not farther than four hand-breadths from the balcony. This can be, for example, the embankment of a pit or well situated in the courtyard.<br />
