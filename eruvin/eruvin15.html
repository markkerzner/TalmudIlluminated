However, Rava says that it does not help, since it was not made expressly for this purpose from the beginning. The Talmud lists a number of possible arguments pro and con, but Rava and <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">A</a>baye remain unconvinced. The law, however, uncharacteristically follows <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">A</a>baye - the side-post helps - and this is the "<a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/04/eruvin-15-abaye-wins.html">L</a>" in the six cases abbreviated  <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/05/bava-metzia-21-lost-objects-that-finder.html">Y</a>   <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">A</a>   <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/04/eruvin-15-abaye-wins.html">L</a>   <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/11/kiddushin-51-should-betrothal-allow.html">K</a>  G  <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">M</a>  where the law follows <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">A</a>baye against Rava. <br/> <br/> The side-post can be made of any material, and it can even be an animal. Here, however, Rabbi <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">M</a>eir disagrees - since anything that is alive cannot serve as a partition, according to him. Correspondingly, the Sages will say that an animal that is used as a coffin cover will become ritually impure, and Rabbi <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">M</a>eir will say that it won't. Tangentially, one can write a divorce document on an animal - but Rabbi <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/05/bava-metzia-21-lost-objects-that-finder.html">Y</a>ose does not allow this. What are their reasons? Rabbi <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/05/bava-metzia-21-lost-objects-that-finder.html">Y</a>ose says that the divorce document, or Get, is called in the Torah "The book (sefer) of separation." Just as a book is not alive and does not eat - so must be the material for the divorce document. <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">A</a>nd the Sages? They understand the word "sefer" as "story," which can be written on anything. <br/> <br/> <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">A</a>rt: Caspar David Friedrich - <a href = "http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/04/eruvin-15-abaye-wins.html">L</a>andscape with Grave, Coffin and Owl</body></html>
