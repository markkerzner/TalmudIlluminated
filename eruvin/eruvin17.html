If the thickness of the ropes together adds up to a hand-breadth, then they have a valid fence ten hand-breadths high. They could also surround their camp with vertical poles, ten hand-breadths high, and place them at three hand-breadths from each other. <br/> <br/> How does this work? It relies on the principles of "Closing", "Lavud" in Hebrew, which states that a gap of three hand-breadths can be considered closed for the purposes of Shabbat, ritual purity, and other similar laws where partitions are involved. <br/> <br/> However, there are those who disagree. Rabbi Yehudah limits the partition of ropes only for a caravan of three or more people. His son Rabbi Yose is even more strict: he says that any partition that does not have criss-cross elements is not a partition. The Sages, however, say that a partition can be either vertical or horizontal. <br/> <br/> Wait a minute! The Sages are repeating themselves!? - This is another group of Sages, and they differ with the first one in permitting such partition even for an individual at home, not in a desert. <br/> <br/> Art: Francesco Peluso - An Algerian Caravan At Rest</body></html>
