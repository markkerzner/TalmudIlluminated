The wall is a separate private area; there is nothing wrong in going there, as well as nothing wrong in eating there. However, none of the courtyard's residents can bring the fruit down into his courtyard, because the wall is not part of any eruv, and he would be transferring from one private domain to another private domain - and that is exactly what the Sages prohibited, in order that the people living in courtyards have some reminder that carrying on Shabbat from a public area (street) to a private area (courtyard) is prohibited by the Torah. <br/> <br/> Art:Â A basket of fruit by Jan Hendrik Aikes</body></html>
