Potentially, one might be concerned that the animals will eat the haystack up, making it less than ten hand-breadths in height, and in this way nullifying the partition. The rule above tells us exactly that: we should not be concerned about such a possibilty, since normally animals don't eat that much in the course of one Shabbat. <br/> <br/> However, if the animals ate enough of the straw during the week before Shabbat, and the height of the haystack is lower than ten hand-breadths on a section that is at least ten amot (20 feet) long - the haystack no longer serves as a partition; the people in both courtyards have to join in a common eruv, and they can no longer use their individual eruv for each courtyard. <br/> <br/> Art: Haystack At Sunset by Martin Johnson Heade 1819-1904</body></html>
