This eruv will allow the residents of each courtyard to carry in it, but not into the courtyard. Even if they fill the ditch with stubble or straw, it still separates them, because those materials will not remain there but will likely be removed. If, however, they fill the ditch with earth or pebbles, then - since those materials will likely stay n there - the ditch has been effectively closed, and they can only make one eruv for all of them. <br/> <br/> If one put a board of at least four hand-breadths wide over the ditch, then now they have a choice. If they want, then can look at this board is a connector which allows them to join in a mutual eruv. Or, then can view this board as merely a bridge but not a connector, and create individual eruv for each of the courtyards. <br/> <br/> Art: Clearing a Ditch, 1839 by John Frederick Herring Snr 1795 - 1865</body></html>
