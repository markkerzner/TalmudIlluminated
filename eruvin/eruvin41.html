Should one complete the fast and maintain his serious grief, or should he eat a little, so as not to enter Shabbat while suffering? For example, Rabbi Akiva would eat a raw egg without salt. The final conclusion is that one should complete a full fast until it is definitely night, and only then start the Shabbat meal.

<a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/04/eruvin-32-ones-dwelling-on-shabbat.html">We already discussed</a> that on Shabbat and Festivals, one may not leave his residence area, that is, about two thousand steps from his abode, which may be a city, a stand-alone house in a field, or just a personal space, four steps around himself, if he happens to be outside in the open field. Thus, if he is all alone in a field on Shabbat, he may walk the four steps of personal space, plus a circle of two thousand amot (roughly, steps). This circle is called his "techum".
<br />
<br />
If gentiles removed him from his techum - he looses his residence area, and in the new place he can only walk four steps around but no more. The same holds true if he leaves his techum while being temporarily deranged. If they then returned him to his residence, he regains the complete techum, because he is not to be blamed or punished for what happened. 
<br />
<br />
Tangentially, some things cause a person to go against his own will and that of his Maker: idolaters who  force him to do wrong (like in the above example), and the pressure of poverty. Why do we need to know? - to pre-emptively pray to be spared. However,  one who suffers from poverty and intestinal disorders in this world, comes purified into the next one. Some also add here a bad wife.
