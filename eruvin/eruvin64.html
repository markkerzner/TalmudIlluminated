However, there is a loophole: one can rent this personâ€™s rights in the courtyard, and even from his servant. One can also become friendly with the person, do him some service, and be considered his servant for this.<br />
<br />
On hearing this rule, Rav Nachman said, "How nice is it!" However, on hearing another rule, that one who drank wine (even 2-3 ounces) cannot render legal decisions, he said, "This is not nice. I, for one, cannot  judge until I clear my mind with wine." However, Rava quoted to him, "<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2829.htm">One who sees prostitutes will lose his wealth</a>." The word "prostitutes," "zonot" in Hebrew, can be understood as "zo nae", which means "this one is nice," so allegorically one he says "this law is nice, this one is not" will lose his learning. Rav Nachman said, "I am convinced and change my mind ."<br />
