However, charity has a special aspect to it. Whereas a promised sacrifice needs to be brought before one, two, or more Holidays pass - depending upon <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/rosh-hashanah/rosh-hashanah3.html">which opinion you follow</a> - the obligation to give charity takes effect immediately, and one violates the "do not delay" prohibition by not paying. Why is that? Simply because the obligation to bring a sacrifice is active only when there is a chance to do so, but poor people are found at all times. It is thus not related to any occasion or Festival. <br/> <br/> What about an heir, does he acquire the "do not delay" obligation from his parent, to bring a sacrifice that he father has designated? On the one hand, the Torah said "when you promise," and the heir did not make a promise. On the other hand, it also said, "you will bring," and perhaps this does include the heir. Rabbi Chiya offered an answer: "God will require it from you," - which means to tell us, "from you, but not from your heir." The heir thus does not acquire the parent's obligation. <br/> <br/> Art: The Artist's Parents By Philipp Otto Runge</body></html>
