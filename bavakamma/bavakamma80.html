Rabbis wished to facilitate the Jewish settlement of the Land of
Israel. They prohibited raising small domesticated animals, such as
sheep and goats, in Israel - since they tend to wonder off in search of
grazing and destroy the vegetation in the peoples' fields.</div><div><br></div><div>It
is allowed to keep sheep and goats needed as sacrifices for 30 days
prior to festivals. Butchers have similar allowances. It is not
prohibited to raise large domesticated animals like cows in Israel,
because it is hard to import them.</div><div><br></div><div>For the laws today, see <a href="http://www.chaburas.org/20cent.html">Har Tzvi</a>. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A door closed on person's success will not speedily be opened except with prayer and self-improvement.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a84639/go">Quiz</a></div></body></html>
