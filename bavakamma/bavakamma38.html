the ox of a Jew gored an ox of the Temple treasury, or if an ox of the
Temple treasury gored the ox of a Jew, the owner is exempt: &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-35.htm">...ox of his
fellow...</a>&#8221; - and not an ox of the Temple treasury.<br>
<br>
If
the ox of a Jew gored the ox of a Canaanite, the Jew is exempt, but if
the ox of a Canaanite gored the ox of a Jew, the Canaanite pays full
damages &#8211; a penalty on Canaanites who had no court system and were
generally not careful about other people's possessions (Meiri), thus
not applicable today.
