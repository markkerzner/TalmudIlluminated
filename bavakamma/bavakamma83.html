do we asses actual damage? If the assailant blinded the victim's eye,
cut off his hand, or broke his leg, we view the victim as if he were a
servant being sold in the market, and we appraise how much he was worth
before he was wounded and how much he is worth now.<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a84760/go">Test yourself</a></body></html>
