priestly gifts were given to Aaron and his sons, and they were given
with a &#8220;generalization-specification-generalization&#8221; rule. One who
upholds these gifts is considered as though he upheld the whole Torah,
which is exposed with this rule.<br><br>If one robs something and feeds
it to his children, they are not liable to pay. If he left the item as
inheritance, they have to return it. Once the stolen property is no
longer extant, they are not liable to return it, unless the father left
also real property &#8211; for it is then mortgaged for his theft.<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a86557/go">Test yourself</a>
