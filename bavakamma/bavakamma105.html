one stole three bundles that were valued at three perutot, and their
value decreased and stood at only two perutot, then even if the thief
returned two of the bundles to the victim, he is still liable to return
the other one, worth nothing (less than a perutah).<br><br>This can be deduced from the <a href="http://talmudpagein100words.com/bavakamma/bavakamma96.html">case of bread stolen before Passover</a>,
where he may say to the owner, &#8220;Behold, that which is yous is right
here before you,&#8221; - only because it is present. Here too, he has to
return the third bundle, or pay what it was worth at the time of theft.<br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a86169/go"><br>Test yourself</a></body></html>
