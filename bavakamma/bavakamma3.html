(using horns) is unique in that the ox's intent is to damage, and it is
the owner's property, and he needs to watch it; its subcategories
include squatting and kicking.<br><br>Eating (tooth) is unique in that
the animal's intent is for self-gratification; its subcategories
include an animal scratching against the wall or soiling fruit by
frolicking.<br><br>Do subcategories have the same laws as the main
damages? Mostly yes, with the exception of a case where a cow was
walking and a pebble shot from under its foot and broke vessels, for
which the owner pays only half the damages.
