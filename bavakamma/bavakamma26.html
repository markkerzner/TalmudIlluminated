man is never innocent regarding damages, in that he always pays in full
for whatever he damages, whether he did the damage unintentionally or
intentionally, while awake or asleep. If he blinded the eye of his

if he blinded the eye of his fellow unintentionally, he pays for the
actual damages but not the &#8220;four things.&#8221;</div></body></html>
