one threw a utensil from the top of a roof, and someone came along and
shattered this utensil in midair with a stick, is the one wielding the
stick liable, or has he merely broken a broken utensil? Is the utensil
considered broken form the start of the process?<br><br>Can we rely on
another ruling: if chickens were pecking at the rope of a bucket, and
it snapped, and the bucket broke, the owner of the chicken is
responsible for damages. Is it because the bucket is broken from the
beginning of the fall and thus the chickens are directly responsible?
No! Damages for the rope.</body></html>
