an ox shall gore a man or a woman and he shall die, the ox shall surely
be stoned; its flesh may not be eaten and the owner of the ox shall be
innocent."</a><br><br>Since &#8220;... the ox shall surely be stoned...&#8221;
means that it died without proper slaughtering and is forbidden for
consumption, then &#8220;...its flesh may not be eaten...&#8221; teaches that even
if the owner slaughtered it, its meat is still forbidden.<br><br>And
&#8220;...the owner of the ox shall be innocent (clean)...&#8221; teaches that he
can't sell it, as people say, &#8220;so-and-so has gone out clean of his
possessions.&#8221;
