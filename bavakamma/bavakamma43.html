&nbsp;teach us? To make the owner of a goring ox liable to redemption
payment for the killing of a woman as for a man? No, it is already
written: &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-28.htm">if an ox shall gore a man or a woman</a>...&#8221; &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Rather,
to equate a woman with a man in damages: if a man dies before
collecting, his damages go to his heirs, so too a woman - her damages
go to her heirs and not to her husband &#8211; because the husband inherits
only the actual assets that the wife possessed at the time of her death.</div></body></html>
