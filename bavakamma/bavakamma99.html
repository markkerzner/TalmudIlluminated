one gave an article to craftsmen to fix, and they ruined it, they are
liable to pay. If a builder contracted to demolish a wall and damaged
passersby &#8211; he, and not the homeowner, is liable. If he was demolishing
from one side and it fell, against his best estimate, from the other
side, he is not liable. But if it fell because of his blow, he is
liable.</div><div><br></div><div>An expert slaughterer who was given an
animal to slaughter for a fee and bungled by slaughtering it improperly
is liable to pay the animal's owner. Therefore, one should give him
money before he slaughters the animal.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a85738/go">Test yourself</a></div></body></html>
