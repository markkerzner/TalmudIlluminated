&nbsp;Wouldn't I know it by logic: a man is liable for killing a man,
whether adult or minor, and an ox is liable for killing a man &#8211; must
be, whether adult of minor? No, man's law is more strict, with
liability for pain, cure, etc. Therefore, the verse is needed.</div><div><br></div><div>If
an ox was rubbing itself against the wall and the wall collapsed on a
man and killed him, or if the ox intended to kill an animal but instead
killed man, or to kill a Canaanite but instead killed a Jew, the ox is
exempt.</div></body></html>
