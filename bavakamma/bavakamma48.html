one brought his ox into a homeowner's courtyard without permission and
the homeowner's ox gored it or the homeowners dog bit it, the homeowner
is exempt from liability; and if the trespasser's ox gored the
homeowner's ox, the trespasser is liable.<br><br>If the trespasser's ox
fell into the homeowner's cistern and fouled its waters, the trespasser
is liable. If the homeowners father or his son was in the cistern and
was killed by the falling ox, the trespasser must pay redemption
reparation. But if he brought his ox into the courtyard with the
owner's permission and it was damaged there, the owner of the courtyard
is liable.<br><br><a href="http://mystudiyo.com/ch/a82593/go">Take a quiz</a></body></html>
