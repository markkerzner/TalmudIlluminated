one robbed wool and liquid dye belonging to someone, and dyed that wool
with the dye, and now returns the dyed wool to the owner &#8211; is the
improvement of dye considered something material? <div><br></div><div>That
is, when the thief returns the dyed wool to the owner, is he returning
both the dye and the wool? Or, perhaps that improvement is not
considered something material, and thus he is returning only the wool
but not the dye &#8211; which has in effect disappeared? </div><div><br></div><div>The
question is relevant when the dyed wool became cheap. Does the thief
have to pay for the dye? Talmud doesn't resolve the question.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a85936/go">Test yourself</a></div></body></html>
