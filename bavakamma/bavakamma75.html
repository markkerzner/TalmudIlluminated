the fact that one sold an ox or sheep was established by the testimony
of two witnesses, and the fact that he then slaughtered or sold the
stolen animal was established by the testimony of one witness or by his
own admission, he pays the twofold payment for stealing, but not the
fourfold or fivefold payment, for lack of proof.</div><div><br></div><div>If
he stole a sheep and then slaughtered it on the Sabbath, he pays the
twofold payment for stealing, but not the fourfold payment for
slaughtering, because slaughtering on the Sabbath is a capital offense
