<div>If
one steals an animal and slaughters it in the Temple, but without
consecrating it as a sacrifice, he is liable to fourfold or fivefold
payment. We see from here that slaughtering becomes legally valid only
at the end of the cut. Had slaughtering been valid from the beginning
of the cut, the animal would have become forbidden for benefit after
the start of slaughter and stop belonging to the owner, resulting in no
fourfold payment.</div>

</div>
<div>If the fact that one stole
and sold an ox or sheep was established by the testimony of two
witnesses, who were later found to be false witnesses, the witnesses
pay the fourfold or fivefold payment.</div>
