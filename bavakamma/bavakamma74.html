witnesses testified that one person murdered another. Later another set
of witnesses came and contradicted the first, and then also made them
false witnesses by saying that &#8220;you were with us in a different place
at this time and therefore could not have witnessed the murder&#8221;.</div><div><br></div><div>Rabbi
Yochanan says that the first witnesses are executed, for although their
testimony was invalidated and set aside, and they stopped being
witnesses, they are still punished as false witnesses. Rabbi Elazar
says that they are not executed, because the rule of &#8220;contradiction is
the beginning of making witnesses false&#8221; is not true.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a84259/go">Test your knowledge...</a></div></div></body></html>
