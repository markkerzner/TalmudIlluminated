case of one living in the house of his fellow without the latter's
knowledge is in essence &#8220;this one benefits and this one does not
lose,&#8221; and the final decision on it is that the squatter doesn't need
to pay rent.<br><br>Additional support for this ruling comes from &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/24-12.htm">through desolation the gate is broken apart</a>,&#8221;
meaning that demons of desolation ruin the house, or alternatively from
the reason that the residents see what needs repair and attend to it.
What is the practical difference between these two reasons? Using the
house for storing wood ans straw.
