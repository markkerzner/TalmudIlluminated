are a penalty. Thus if a dog killed and ate sheep or a cat killed and
ate a chicken, it is a case of unusual damage, and it is not collected
in court. This however only applies to large animals, but small animals
are "tooth" damage and it can be collected.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Five
damagers are considered unusual and liable for only half-damage:
domestic animal to gore, push, bite, squat, and kick. Among the five
damagers considered normal, with their owners "warned" of the complete
liability: animal while walking ("foot"), ox that already gored, and a
man that does damage.</div></body></html>
