are four primary categories of damages, and all other cases can be
classified as belonging to one of these: the ox, the pit, the man, and
the fire.<br><br>Liability for one can not be deduced from the other.
For example, a man is responsible in full for even accidental damage,
while the owner of an ox is liable for half the damage the first three
times; a fire isn't alive; and a pit doesn't move around.<br><br>However, since they can all damage, the owner is responsible to watch over them and to pay damages from the choicest land.
