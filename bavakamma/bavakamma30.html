one puts out straw or stubble into the public domain to be converted
into manure by people and animals stepping on it, and another person is
damaged by them, the owner of the straw is liable for damages, and
whoever is the first to take the straw acquires it &#8211; but we do not
announce this last law in public.<br><br>Even in those cases where it
is allowed to put hazardous objects out, such as pouring water out in
the street in a rainy season, if a passerby is damaged by it, the one
who poured out the water is liable.
