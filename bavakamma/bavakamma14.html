the damage done by tooth or foot of an animal happened in a jointly
owned yard, then if the yard was set for joint use for produce but not
for oxen, the damager is liable.<br><br>Any three knowledgeable persons
who have mastered related areas of law can form a court to judge
ordinary cases of damages. However, unusual cases involving penalties,
such as half-damages awarded in the first three instances of goring by
an ox, can only be judged by people possessing uninterrupted chain of
ordination since the time of Moses. Therefore, such cases can not be
judged today.
