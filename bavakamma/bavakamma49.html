an ox intended to gore its fellow ox, and it struck a pregnant women
instead, and her offspring were miscarried, the ox's owner is exempt
from paying for the value of the offspring.<br><br>But if a <span style="font-style: italic;">person</span> intended to strike his fellow and instead struck a pregnant woman and her offspring were miscarried, <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-22.htm">he must pay her husband the full value of the offspring</a>
- for which they assess how much she was worth before giving birth, and
how much after miscarriage, using prices of the slave market. Of
course, if the woman suffered additional injury, that damage is
assessed separately.<br><br><a href="http://mystudiyo.com/ch/a82604/go/play">Quiz for the page</a></body></html>
