the Wicked delivered a blow to the ear of a certain person. Rav Huna
said to Chanan: &#8220;Give the victim half a zuz.&#8221; Chanan had a worn-out zuz
but couldn't change it. He delivered a second blow to the other ear and
gave the person the zuz.</div><div><br></div><div>If an ox is warned
regarding its own species but not other species, or regarding young
animals but not mature animals, the owner pays full damages where
warned but half damages where not warned. Students asked Rabbi Yehudah
about an ox warned for goring on Sabbath. He said, &#8220;for goring on
Sabbath he pays full damages, on weekdays, half-damages.&#8221;</div></body></html>
