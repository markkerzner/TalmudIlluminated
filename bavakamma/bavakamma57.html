the finder of a lost object treated as a paid custodian, liable even if
the object is stolen or lost, or as an unpaid custodian, liable only
for negligence?</div><div><br></div><div>Ruling: if the finder returned
it where the owner will see it, he is not obligated to deal with it
further, but if it was stolen or lost, he is responsible. Doesn't it
follow that it was stolen or lost from the finder's home, and he is
thus a paid custodian? No! It was stolen from the place where he
returned it, because he returned it in the afternoon, too late for the
owner to see it.</div></div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://mystudiyo.com/ch/a83079/go/play">Quiz for this page</a></div></body></html>
