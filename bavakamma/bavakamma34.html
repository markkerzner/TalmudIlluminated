if a man's ox shall push the ox of his fellow, and it dies, they shall
sell the live ox and divide its money, and the dead one, too, they
shall divide.</a>&#8221;  What are the precise circumstances?<br><br>In the case of one ox worth two hundred <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuz_%28coin%29">zuz</a>
that gored another ox worth two hundred and the carcass is worth fifty,
one owner takes half of the live ox and half of the dead one, and so
does the other. Each party thus suffers half the loss, and the damager
can give the carcass as a partial payment.
