difference exists between the nature of the half payment in the case of
an innocent and the nature of the full payment in the case of an
established damager? The owner's liability in the case of innocent
first-time gorings is <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-35.htm">limited to the value of the ox that did the damage</a>, and in the case of established damagers the owner pays pays the full amount of the damage with his best property.<br><br>Regarding
what is the foot of an animal considered an established damager? For
breaking things in the course of its walking but not when kicking.
