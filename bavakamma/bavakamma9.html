the verse states "...he [the owner of the pit] shall return money..." ,
it means to include an article worth money as an acceptable form of
payment, and even something such as bran. There are three ways to
understand this:<br><br>1. One can pay with bran only if he has no money and no land;<br>2. One can pay with bran only if he doesn't have money;<br>3. One can pay with bran even if he has money, and if he has no money or movables left, then he needs to pay with superior land.
