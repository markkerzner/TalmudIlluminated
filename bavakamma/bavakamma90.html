who boxes (alternatively, shouts into) the ear of his fellow must give
him a Sela ($200), but Rabbi Yehudah says, a Maneh ($5,000). If he
slapped him on his cheek, he gives him 200 zuz ($10,000), if he did it
with the back of his hand, 400 zuz.<br><br>If he pulled his ear, yanked
his hair, spat on him and his spittle reached him, removed his cloak
from him, or bared the head of a woman in the marketplace, he gives him
(or her) 400 zuz ($20,000).<br><br>This is the general rule: Everything depends on the victim's level of honor, and the amount above are the maximum.<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a85266/go">Test yourself</a></body></html>
