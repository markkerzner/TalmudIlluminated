there is a pit of two partners and the first one passed by and did not
cover it, and then the second one passed by it and did not cover it,

they both simultaneously uprooted a clump of earth from its bottom.<br></div><div><br></div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a82714/go">Today's quiz</a></body></html>
