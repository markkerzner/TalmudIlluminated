one knocks the coin out of his fellow's hand, and the coin falls into
the sea, but it is possible to retrieve it, he can say, &#8220;There's your
coin, go get it&#8221; and not be liable. Similarly, one who burns a loan
document of his fellow, so that the loan can't be collected, is not
liable to pay, for he says to his fellow &#8220;I burned a mere paper of
yours.&#8221; In both of these cases the damages are not direct but
