an ox was pursuing another ox and the pursued ox was later found
damaged, and the damaged party says: &#8220;Your ox caused the damage,&#8221; but
the owner of the pursuing ox says, &#8220;Not so, rather it injured itself on
a rock&#8221; - the burden of proof rests on the one who seeks to exact money
from his fellow.<br><br>If two oxen were pursuing an ox and it was
later found damaged, and the owner of one pursuing ox says &#8220;Your ox did
the damage,&#8221; but the owner of the other says, &#8220;No, your ox did the
damage&#8221; - both are exempt, because each can shift the blame to the
other.
