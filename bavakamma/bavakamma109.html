one robs his father and swore falsely to him in denial of the robbery,
and the father dies, and the son then admits his guilt &#8211; he pays the
principal and the one-fifth surcharge (for false oath) to his father's
other sons or to the father's brothers &#8211; who are the next in line to
inherit.<br><br>Although the robber is his father's heir, he may not
keep that which he stole &#8211; for he must fulfill the dictate to return
stolen property.<br><br>If he doesn't wish or can't pay, he may borrow
from others, repay, and his creditors will may then come and collect
the debt from his inheritance.<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a86458/go">Test yourself</a></body></html>
