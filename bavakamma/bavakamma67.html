someone stole a hide and trimmed it for use, he acquired it, and it is
now susceptible to ritual impurity. If he only designated it in his
mind as a tray, it also became a utensil susceptible to ritual

was a hide, and is now a tray. This question remained unresolved for 22

Academy and received Divine assistance in resolving questions, so that
his reputation would be enhanced.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a83853/go">Quiz</a></div></div></div></body></html>
