combined, can the two teach liability for fire? Ox has the intent to
damage, whereas fire does not. However a man is liable even for damage
which he inflicts while sleeping. Thus, the intent to damage is not
essential.<br><br>Man is liable for four damage payments, but fire for
just one. However, the ox disproves that, since it is also liable for
just one payment.<br><br>Man and ox are alive, and fire is not, thus liability for fire had to be mentioned in the Torah.
