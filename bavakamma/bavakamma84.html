From here we see that the assailant gives money as payment for the damage.<br><br>In the school of Chizkiyah they taught &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-24.htm">an eye for an eye</a>.. and a ...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-23.htm">life for a life</a>...&#8221;
and not a life and an eye for an eye. If it enters your mind that the
payment for blinding someone is losing an actual eye, it could happen
that at the time when the court was blinding the assailant he died.
This means that an eye for an eye refers to a monetary payment.<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a84837/go">Test yourself</a></body></html>
