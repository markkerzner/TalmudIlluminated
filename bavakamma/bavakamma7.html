for the damage from the choicest of his land, based on <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-5.htm">this passage</a>.<br>
<br>
Whose best land is it?<br>
<br>
Rabbi
Ishmael says: "The damaged party's choicest field, or the damaged
party's choicest vineyard." Why? Just as another man's field (mentioned
before) was that of the damaged party, so too the payment is measured
by the quality of the damaged party's land.<br>
<br>
And Rabbi Akiba
says: "'...he shall pay his choicest field...'" clearly means - with
the choicest field of the one who is paying."<br>
<br>
Money or valuables are also acceptable.
