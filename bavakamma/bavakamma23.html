a person lit a fire in his field and the fire spread, that person is
liable. Is that fire his &#8220;property,&#8221; and he is liable only for the
damages, or is it &#8220;arrows&#8221; - his own force, and he is liable also for
pain, healing, and unemployment? It is &#8220;arrows.&#8221;<br><br>A cow is only
liable for eating someone else's fruit if it veered into this someone's
field. The owner of the cow could try to claim that the cow's mouth is
his premises, and &#8220;what is your fruit doing in my cow's mouth?&#8221;, but
the above case of a dog that ate a biscuit precludes this.
