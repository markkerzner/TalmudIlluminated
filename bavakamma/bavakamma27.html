one threw a child off the top of a roof and another met the falling
child with an upturned sword, Rabbi Yehudah ben Betaira says that the
one wielding the sword is liable to execution because he hastened the
death of the child, but the Rabbis absolve him, because the child is
considered partly dead. They argue if &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/24-17.htm">all human life</a>&#8221;  means any or all of it.<br><br>If
one places a jug in the public domain and another comes and stumbles
and breaks it, the pedestrian is not liable. If the pedestrian was
damaged by it, the owner of the jug is liable.
