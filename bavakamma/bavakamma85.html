do we calculate compensation for pain? We assess how much money a
person wants to give to have his hand -that is anyway inscribed to the
government for amputation - anesthetized, to avoid the difference
between amputation by sword and amputation by potion, presumably
painless.</div><div><br></div><div>How do we calculate loss of
employment? We view the victim as though he were a watchman of
cucumbers, since this is all he can in his current state without a
hand. And if you say that the person will earn more when he recovers &#8211;
that payment is already included in the payment for his hand.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a84859/go">Test yourself</a></div></body></html>
