two potters were walking one behind the other in the public domain, and
the first one stumbled and fell, and then the second one stumbled and
fell over the first, the first one is liable for the damages to the
second.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Although the potter lying on the
ground caused the damage passively, this is a case of damage inflicted
by &#8220;man,&#8221; since the obstacle was his body. He is consequently liable
even for the damage to the second person's utensils. Although stumbling
is not negligence, he should have warned the person behind him.</div></body></html>
