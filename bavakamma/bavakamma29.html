one's pitcher of water broke in the public domain and another person
slipped in the water, Rabbi Yehudah makes the owner of the pitcher
liable only when he at least had the intent to put the pitcher down.
Rabbi Meir makes him liable even when he stumbled or if the pitcher
broke by itself; if a camel stumbled, he is liable if he stumbled
first, and the camel tripped over him.<br><br>They also argue after the
breakage: one maintains that if a person leaves his hazardous objects
and declares them ownerless, he is liable, while the other one
maintains that the person is not liable.</div></div></body></html>
