two people were walking in the public thoroughfare, one was running,
and one was walking, or both were running, and they did damage to one
another, both are not liable to pay damages.<br><br>Said Rabbi
Yochanan, - this ruling is only talking about the time right before
Shabbat, when running for the sake of Shabbat is allowed, but otherwise
the one who runs is liable.<br><br>If one chops wood in the public
domain and thereby does damage in the private domain; chops in the
private domain and damages in the public; or chops in private and
damages in private, he is liable for full damages.
