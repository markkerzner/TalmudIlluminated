an animal fell into a garden and was saved from injury by the produce,
the owner pays for the benefit of saving it from injury. The owner
can't claim that his friend was doing a mitzvah saving his animal.</div><div><br></div><div>If
the animal continued eating, the owner pays for not having to feed it
next time. Once the animal knows its way to the garden, the owner is
liable if he doesn't watch it more closely.</div><div><br></div><div>If
the owner was negligent and has to pay full damages in the field, they
are estimated as a &nbsp;loss in value of a field sixty times larger, with a
similar damage.</div><div><br></div><div><a href="http://mystudiyo.com/ch/a83081/go/play">Quiz for this page</a></div></body></html>
