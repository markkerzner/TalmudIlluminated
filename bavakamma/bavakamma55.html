who brought a sheep into a fold and properly locked the gate after it,
but it escaped and damaged the property of another, is not liable to
pay for the damage; one who didn't properly lock the gate is liable.<br><br>If
the fold was breached at night, or robbers breached it, he is not
liable; if the robbers took the sheep out, the robbers are liable.<br><br>If
he left the sheep in the sun or gave it over to an deaf-mute, deranged,
or minor and it escaped and damaged, he is liable; if he gave it over
to a shepherd, the shepherd assumes the responsibility.<br><br><a href="http://www.mystudiyo.com/ch/a82968/go">Today's quiz</a></body></html>
