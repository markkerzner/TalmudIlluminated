of the four damagers: ox, pit, man, and fire, the term for "man", or
"ma'veh" can have various translations. Rav translates mav'eh as a
seeker, or man; Shmuel translates it as "tooth" of an animal consuming
produce. Then how does this "tooth" differ from ox? The intent of
eating (tooth) is to have pleasure, while the intent of goring (ox) is
to harm.<br><br>Rabbi Oshaya listed thirteen primary damagers: unpaid
custodian, borrower, paid custodian, renter, bully, pain, healing,
unemployment, and humiliation, plus the four primary damagers above.
Why does the Mishna not include these? - It listed man and meant all
types of damage inflicted by man.
