properties can be acquired by dint of land acquisition, and no
additional act of acquisition (such as lifting) is then required, based
on "...<a href="http://bible.cc/2_chronicles/21-3.htm">And their father gave them many gifts of gold and silver, and delicacies, together with the fortified cities in Judah</a>." Since the slaves are inherited like land, based on "...<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/25-46.htm">you shall bequeath them as permanent property</a>..." can one acquire movables together with the slaves? - No, because they move, unlike cities in Judah.<div> </div><div>One is not liable for damages to properties belonging to the Temple, based on "...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-35.htm">the ox of his fellow</a>..."  </div></body></html>
