If he designated white ones in a dovecote and in the morning found there black ones, or vice versa, they are forbidden.
<br />
<br />
This rule, however, is obvious! He can't use that he has not designated. Rabbah explained: "He designated two dovecotes, one with ones doves another with black ones, and another with black ones. The rules tells us that he cannnot just say that they exchanged places, but rather, they all flew away and new ones came in their place.
<br />
<br />
Can we derive a logical principle from here? There are two ways to decide matters: follow the majority (and the majority of doves are not designated for his consumption) or follow the local situation (and locally we have just two dovecotes, both designated). So could we say that the world majority is more important than the specific local situation? - No, perhaps we cannot. Perhaps in our case there is a platform in front of the dovecote, and birds from other parts of the world constantly roost there. Normally they don't enter the dovecote, because of the fear of locals. But once the locals leave, they do enter. Thus, in this case the worldly doves and the local majority is one and the same, and we cannnot derive a general principle from this example - even if the principle may still be right.
