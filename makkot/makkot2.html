<span style="font-size: medium;">Two people want 
to disqualify a Kohen by testifying about the marital status of his 
parents. They come to court and state the following: &#8220;We testify about a
 certain man (who until now was presumed to be a qualified Kohen), that 
he is a son of a divorced woman. Later they are found to be plotting 
witnesses: two other witnesses came and ask them, &#8220;How can you say that 
you saw this woman being divorced, when on that day you were with us in a
 different place?&#8221;<br>
<br>
It is impossible to apply to them what they wanted to inflict on the 
defendant, even if they are Kohanim. If we disqualify the children of 
the witnesses, we will violate the commandment of &#8220;do to them (but not 
to their children) what they wanted to do to him.&#8221; And if we do not 
disqualify their children, this is not right either, because they did 
want to disqualify the defendant's children. Therefore, they instead get
 the punishment of forty lashes.<br>
