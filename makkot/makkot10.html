<span style="font-size: medium;">The phrase &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/4-42.htm">and he shall flee to one of 
those cities and live</a>&#8221; teaches that we have to provide him with 
arrangements that will enable him to live. If he is a student of Torah, 
we exile his teacher with him, because a student cannot survive without 
the one who teaches him Torah. From here we see that  a person should 
not teach a disciple who is not of good character. Furthermore, if the 
teacher is exiled, his academy is exiled with him.<br>
<br>
Rav Chama used to say, &#8220;If <a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/25-8.htm">God
 guides sinners on the way</a>,&nbsp; He surely guides the righteous.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Resh Lakish used to explain the phrase &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-13.htm">but God caused it to come to his
 hand</a>&#8221; with this example. Two people killed a person, one 
inadvertently, and one intentionally, but there were no witnesses 
against both. God causes one to sit under a ladder while the other one 
descends, falls on him, and kills him, this time with witnesses. One is 
thus executed, and the other one exiled.<br>
