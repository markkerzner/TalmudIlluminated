If he is a student of Torah, we exile his teacher with him, because a student cannot survive without the one who teaches him Torah. From here we see that a person should not teach a disciple who is not of good character. Furthermore, if the teacher is exiled, his academy is exiled with him. <br/> <br/> Rav Chama used to say, "If <a href = "http://bible.cc/psalms/25-8.htm">God guides sinners on the way</a> ,Â  He surely guides the righteous." <br/> <br/> Resh Lakish used to explain the phrase " <a href = "http://bible.cc/exodus/21-13.htm">but God caused it to come to his hand</a> " with this example. Two people killed a person, one inadvertently, and one intentionally, but there were no witnesses against both. God causes one to sit under a ladder while the other one descends, falls on him, and kills him, this time with witnesses. One is thus executed, and the other one exiled. <br/> <br/> Art: Isaac Snowman - Three Rabbis Of Jerusalem</body></html>
