<span style="font-size: medium;">If a tree stands 
inside a city of refuge, but its branches lean outside, and the killer 
is clinging to the trunk, the redeemer of the blood may still kill him, 
because we consider only the branches. Rav Ashi says, "Also the 
branches" - which changes the ruling to say just the opposite: the 
killer is protected if the tree is inside and he is under the leaves 
outside.<br>
<br>
If an exiled killer inadvertently killed someone else in that city of 
refuge where he resides, he is exiled from his neighborhood to a 
different neighborhood. If a Levite inadvertently killed someone in his 
home city, he is exiled from his city to another city.<br>
<br>
If a killer was exiled to a city of refuge and the townspeople wanted to
 honor him, he must tell them, &#8220;I am a killer.&#8221; If they wanted to do it 
anyway, they are allowed. In the six designated cities of refuge the 
killer does not have to pay rent. The other forty-two cities of the 
Levites also serve as cities of refuge, but the killer who resides there
 has to pay rent. <br>
<br>
After the killer returns home, Rabbi Meir says that he returns to the 
position of authority he had occupied previously, but Rabbi Yehudah says
 that he does not.<br>
