<span style="font-size: medium;">Normally, two 
punishments cannot be administered for one transgression, because one is
 punished &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/25-2.htm">corresponding 
to his wickedness</a>,&#8221; but not more. However, Rabbi Yishmael allows 
both lashes and death penalty, because it is all &#8220;one long death.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Rabbi Yitzchak says that for relations with his sister one is cut off, 
but does not get lashes. Talking about the laws of incest, the Torah <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/20-17.htm">repeated the prohibition of 
one's sister</a>. There is a rule, &#8220;Exception proves the rule.&#8221;  In our 
case, when incest with one's sister is prohibited yet again, on the pain
 of being cut off, this teaches that being cut off is the only 
punishment for it, and one does not get lashes. It then also teaches 
that one does not get lashes for all other similar transgressions.<br>
<br>
The Sages, who don't agree with Rabbi Yitzchak, say that the Torah here 
speaks about someone who fathered two girls with his mother, then a son 
with one of the girls, and his son then had relations with the other 
girl, who is the now his sister, father's sister, and mother's sister &#8211; 
such a person gets three sets of lashes.<br>
