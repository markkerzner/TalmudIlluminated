<span style="font-size: medium;">If two witnesses 
said, &#8220;We testify about this person that he owes his fellow two hundred 
zuz&#8221;, and they are found to be false plotting witnesses, they receive 
lashes for false testimony, and they pay their victim the amount they 
intended to make him lose, since lashes and repayment come from 
different places in the Torah &#8211; this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir. The 
Sages, however, say that whoever pays does not receive lashes, since a 
person cannot be liable to both lashes and monetary payment for the same
 crime.<br>
<br>
If they said, &#8220;We testify about this person that he is liable to forty 
lashes,&#8221; and they are found to be false plotting witnesses, they receive
 eighty lashes &#8211; these are the words of Rabbi Meir, but the Sages make 
them liable to only forty.<br>
