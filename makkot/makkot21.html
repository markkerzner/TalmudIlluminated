<span style="font-size: medium;">To be liable for 
lashes for making a tattoo, one has to perform both steps: puncturing 
the skin and filling the holes with ink. Rabbi Shimon's opinion is that 
one is only liable if he tattoos the name of an idol.<br>
<br>
If a nazir was drinking wine all day, he receives only one set of 
lashes, following the first warning in the morning. If they kept warning
 him, and he kept drinking, he is liable for each warning. Similarly, if
 he was in the cemetery all day, he receives one set of lashes, but if 
they warned him against every entry, he is liable every time. If he was 
shaving his head all day, he is liable once, but if they warned him 
about every hair, he is liable every time.<br>
<br>
There is a case where one plows a single furrow and is liable for eight 
prohibitions: if he plows with an ox and a donkey, and they are 
consecrated, and he covers mixed species in a vineyard, and he does so 
on a Sabbatical years and on a Yom Tov; and he is both a Kohen and a 
nazir, plowing in a cemetery.<br>
