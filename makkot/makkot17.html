<span style="font-size: medium;">The following 
also incur lashes: one who <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/26-1.htm">eats first fruit before its 
owner recites over them the verses prescribed by the Torah</a>; one who 
eats the holy offerings outside the Temple, and one who eats less holy 
offerings outside Jerusalem; and one who breaks a bone of a Passover 
lamb if it is ritually pure.<br>
<br>
If one who takes a mother bird together with her young, Rabbi Yehudah 
says that he incurs lashes and does not need to send the bird away, but 
the Sages say that he must send the bird away, and does not incur 
lashes.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Shimon derives through logic the prohibition of eating first fruit
 mentioned above, by comparing it to <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">the first tithe</a>, and on 
this Rava comments, &#8220;One whose mother is giving birth to him should pray
 that she should give birth to one like Rabbi Shimon,&#8221; and proceeds to 
refute his logic. If so, why the praise? Because Rabbi Shimon knows how 
to change the order of words to arrive at what the Torah really meant.<br>
