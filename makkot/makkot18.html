<span style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Elazar 
says: &#8220;The step of placing the first fruit before the Altar is an 
essential one, and without it the ritual is not complete and the fruit 
cannot be eaten. In contrast, reading the verses is not essential and 
does not invalidate the ritual.&#8221;<br>
<br>
But did Rabbi Elazar really say this? Didn't he say the opposite in the 
following ruling: &#8220;If one separated first fruit before Sukkot, and 
Sukkot has passed, and he didn't bring the first fruit, they must be 
left to rot.&#8221; Why is this? Isn't it because the owner can no longer say 
the verses over them? This proves that Rabbi Elazar considers the verses
 essential!<br>
<br>
The answer is similar to the principle of Rabbi Zeira. For Rabbi Zeira 
has said about flour offering that it must be mixed, and even if it is 
not mixed in practice, this does not matter, as long as the volume 
allows it to be mixed. However, if the volume is too large for mixing, 
the offering is invalid. By the same token, one must be able to say the 
verses. Not saying them is acceptable, but not being able to say them 
invalidates the ritual.<br>
