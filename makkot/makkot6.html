<span style="font-size: medium;">False plotting 
witnesses are liable only if the judgment has been pronounced, but the 
victim has not been executed, since the law is &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/19-19.htm">do to them as they plotted 
to do to their brother</a>&#8221;, and not as they actually did to him. Logic 
would dictate that if the defendant has been executed, all the more so 
the false witnesses should be executed, now that they have caused an 
actual loss of  life. However, there is an overriding rule that one 
cannot derive capital punishments by logic &#8211; only those that are 
explicitly mentioned in the Torah are to be followed.<br>
<br>
What does the phrase &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">by 
the word of two witnesses or three witnesses shall the one who is to die
 be put to death</a>&#8221; teach? That the law of three witnesses is the same
 as the law of two witnesses: to be established as false plotting 
witnesses, all three have to be established thus.<br>
