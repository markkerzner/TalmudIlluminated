<span style="font-size: medium;">Witnesses do not 
become plotting false witnesses, unless other witnesses discredit them 
personally. If they said, &#8220;How can you testify about a murder when this 
murder victim, or this alleged murderer, were with us in a different 
place on that day?&#8221;, they have attacked the testimony, but not the 
witnesses themselves. However, if the new witnesses said, &#8220;How can you 
testify about this event when you were with us on that day in a 
different place?&#8221;, the first witnesses do become plotting false 
witnesses and are executed on the words of the second set of witnesses.<br>
<br>
If the witnesses are convicted as plotting false witnesses, they divide 
the monetary compensation that they have to pay to the intended victim, 
but if they are liable to lashes, they each receive their lashes. That 
is because lashes are comparable to capital punishment, and since there 
is no execution in half, there are also no lashes in half.<br>
