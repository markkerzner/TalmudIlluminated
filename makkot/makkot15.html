<span style="font-size: medium;">In order for 
lashes to be administered, the transgressor must be warned shortly 
before. In the cases where such warning cannot be stated with certainty,
 is the court still allowed to administer lashes?<br>
<br>
For example, one proclaims, &#8220;An oath that I will eat this loaf today!&#8221; 
If he is warned in the morning that he better eat the loaf, or else he 
will receive lashes, this is an uncertain warning, because he may still 
eat the loaf later on. This applies throughout the day: he cannot be 
told with certainty that if does not eat the loaf now he will incur 
lashes, since he can eat it a while later. Potentially, he could be 
warned on the very last moment of a day, but practically it is 
impossible. In this situation, Rabbi Yochanan says that an uncertain 
warning is a legal warning; however, he does not receive lashes because 
he does no action. On the contrary, Resh Lakish does allow lashes even 
for no action, but Resh Lakish considers uncertain warning invalid. 
Thus, according to both, he does not receive lashes, but for different 
reasons.<br>
