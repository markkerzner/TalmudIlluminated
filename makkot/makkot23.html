<span style="font-size: medium;">If one who is 
liable to excision (karet) is lashed, he become exempt from his 
excision, following the verse in the Torah, &#8220;and your brother will be 
demeaned before your eyes&#8221; - after he has been lashed, he is again like 
your brother &#8211; these are the words of Rabbi Chananyah ben Gamliel.<br>
<br>
Excision (karet) is also translated as being cut off. One opinion is 
that it entails both the premature death of the sinner and the loss of 
his future generations. &#8220;Premature death&#8221; is death at the ages of fifty 
through fifty-nine, or even at the ages of sixty through seventy-nine if
 the death is sudden.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Chananya ben Gamliel also said, &#8220;If a person who commits a single 
transgression punishable by being cutoff forfeits his life, then if he 
performs a single mitzvah, how much more so should his life be given to 
him.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Rabbi Shimon says that you can derive this better. The verses say, &#8220;My 
laws by which you shall live &#8230; The souls that do incest will be cut 
off.&#8221; We see from here that whoever desists and does not do a 
transgression is given a reward of the one who performs a mitzvah.<br>
