<span style="font-size: medium;">Since the Torah 
directs us to separate the second tithe and to eat it in Jerusalem, one 
might have thought to fulfill this mitzvah even nowadays. <br>
<br>
However, this notion is refuted by comparison with the firstborn animal.
 Both second tithe and firstborn animals had to be brought to Jerusalem 
and eaten there. And, just as the firstborn animal can only be offered 
at the time when the Temple stands &#8211; because it needs to be sacrificed 
at the Altar &#8211; so too the second tithe can be eaten in Jerusalem when 
the Temple stand. <br>
<br>
This argument, however, has an internal weakness: firstborn requires 
that its blood be placed on the Altar, which is a stringency that the 
second tithe does not have. Then how do we know not to bring the second 
tithe today? Only from the verse, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">In the place where He will 
choose to rest His name &#8211; there you will eat second tithe and the 
firstborn animals</a>.&#8221; Since they are placed next to each other in the 
same verse, they have the same law.<br>
