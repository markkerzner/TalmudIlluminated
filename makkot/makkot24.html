This can also be seen from the verse " <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/33-4.htm">Moses commanded us the Torah as inheritance</a> ". The numerical value of the word Torah is 611, plus the two commandments pronounced by God Himself make up 613. <br/> <br/> King David established <a href = "http://bible.cc/psalms/15-1.htm">11 ethical and moral requirements</a> on which to base the 613. <br/> <br/> Isaiah came and <a href = "http://bible.cc/isaiah/33-15.htm">established them on six</a> : "Walk with righteousness, speak with fairness, spurn extortionate profit, avoid suspicions of taking a bribe, seal the ears from hearing of bloodshed, and shut the eyes from seeing evil." <br/> <br/> Michah established them <a href = "http://bible.cc/micah/6-8.htm">on three</a> : do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with your God. <br/> <br/> Habakkuk established them on one: " <a href = "http://bible.cc/habakkuk/2-4.htm">The righteous person shall live through his faith</a> ". <br/> <br/> Art: John Everett Millais - North-West Passage</body></html>
