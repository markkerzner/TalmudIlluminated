<span style="font-size: medium;">The total number 
of commandments in the Torah is 613. This can also be seen from the 
verse &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/33-4.htm">Moses commanded us
 the Torah as inheritance</a>&#8221;. The numerical value of the word Torah is
 611, plus the two commandments pronounced by God  Himself make up 613.<br>
<br>
King David established <a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/15-1.htm">11 
ethical and moral requirements</a> on which to base the 613. <br>
<br>
Isaiah came and <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/33-15.htm">established 
them on six</a>: &#8220;Walk with righteousness, speak with fairness, spurn 
extortionate profit, avoid suspicions of taking a bribe, seal the ears 
from hearing of bloodshed, and shut the eyes from seeing evil.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Michah established them <a href="http://bible.cc/micah/6-8.htm">on three</a>:
 do justice, love kindness, and walk humbly with your God. <br>
<br>
Habakkuk established them on one: &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/habakkuk/2-4.htm">The righteous person shall live 
through his faith</a>&#8221;.<br>
