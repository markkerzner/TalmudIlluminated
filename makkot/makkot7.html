<span style="font-size: medium;">The phrase &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-6.htm">By the word of two witnesses</a>&#8221;
 additionally teaches that the judges must understand the language 
spoken by witnesses.<br>
<br>
If two witnesses testify that a person was sentenced as a murderer by a 
certain court, and name the time, place, and witnesses in the case, that
 person is executed based on their words.<br>
<br>
A sanhedrin that executes once in seven years is called a destroyer. 
Rabbi Eliezer ben Azaryah says, &#8220;Once is seventy years.&#8221; Rabbi Tarfon 
and Rabbi Akiva say, &#8220;Had we been on the sanhedrin at the time when they
 still performed executions, no person would ever been executed.&#8221; Rabban
 Shimon ben Gamliel says, &#8220;They would just increase the number of 
murderers in Israel,&#8221; because they would have eliminated the criminals' 
fear of retribution.<br>
<br>
One who kills a person inadvertently is exiled into a city of refuge. If
 one was lowering a cask from a roof with the rope and it fell on a 
bystander and killed him, the killer is exiled, but if he was raising a 
cask and the cask fell and killed, the killer is not exiled.<br>
