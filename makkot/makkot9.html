<span style="font-size: medium;">A blind person 
who killed inadvertently is not exiled, since  &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/35-23.htm">without seeing</a>&#8221; excludes 
him from responsibility &#8211; says Rabbi Yehudah. However, Rabbi Meir says 
that there is another exclusion, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/19-4.htm">without awareness</a>,&#8221; and 
double negative becomes affirmative, so a blind inadvertent killer is 
exiled.<br>
<br>
An &#8220;enemy&#8221; is one who deliberately avoided speaking to the victim of 
&#8220;accidental&#8221; killing for three days. An &#8220;enemy&#8221; is not exiled, because 
he can't claim accidental killing. Rabbi Yose says that an &#8220;enemy&#8221; is 
considered forewarned and is executed. Rabbi Shimon looks at the 
circumstances of the case.<br>
<br>
There were three cities of refuge in Transjordan, and three in the land 
of Canaan. Direct roads were constructed to facilitate getting to a city
 of refuge. The court would provide the accidental killer with two Torah
 scholars, and they would try to dissuade the avenging relative from 
wishing to attack.  Then the court would bring him from the city of 
refuge and determine the degree of his responsibility.<br>
