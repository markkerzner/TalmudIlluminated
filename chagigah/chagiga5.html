                            " can be understood to mean that at night God will still help, by hinting of impending troubles in a dream - which will lead to prayer and actions. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chanania was often in the Caesar's palace, and once someone from the entourage signaled to him "You are a nation whose Master turned His face away from." Rabbi Yehoshua signaled him back, "

The Caesar then asked the man, and he said that he could not understand the reply. They Caesar said, "A man who does not understand signs, should he use them in the presence of the king?" and they executed him.

Rabbi Yehudah the Prince was once reading Lamentations, and the book fell from his hand into a deep pit. He commented on this phrase from Lamentation, "

They asked if there lived a Sage in town, and they people answered, "Yes, but he is blind." Rabbi Chiya wanted to go alone, saying that it was not fitting for Rabbi Yehudah the Prince, but Rabbi Yehudah insisted to go greet the Sage. At the end of the visit, the Sage said, "You visited one who is seen but cannot see. Therefore, may you merit to pay respect to the One Who sees but is not seen." Rabbi Yehudah commented, "Had I not come with you, I would not get this blessing."
