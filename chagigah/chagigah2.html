This is actually an obligation: one must make merry. One of the ways of doing so is by bringing the "celebration" sacrifice (chagigah) and eating the meat. <br/> <br/> More specifically, one must come to the Temple during a Holiday. Having come, one should bring a sacrifice, because the Torah said, " <a href = "null">Do not appear before Me empty-handed</a> ." But who is this "one?" In other words, who is obligated to visit the Temple and bring the sacrifice? <br/> <br/> All males are obligated to go the Temple, following the commandment of " <a href = "null">Three times a year every male must appear before God, the Master of the Universe</a> ." Women and minors do not have to go. Also not included are people of undetermined sex (tumtum), hermaphrodite, a deaf-mute, deranged, and one who physically can't walk up the Temple Mount. <br/> <br/> Why does the rule start with "All males," if later it gives all the details? - This is to silently include an additional class of people, half-free and half-slave. We have <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/daf-in/daf-in100.html">discussed this special situation before</a> : such a person cannot marry a slave woman because he is free, but cannot marry a free woman, because he is a slave. He does not have to visit the Temple either. However, the Sages later establishes that the court should force the slave's master to free the half-slave part. <br/> <br/> <br/> Art" Village Celebrations by David The Younger Teniers</body></html>
