If he knowingly ruled incorrectly or knowingly performed the forbidden act, he does not bring this sacrifice. His law is thus similar to the court's ruling that it makes for the community.<br />
<br />
If he ruled incorrectly together with the court and performed the act together with the congregation, he does not bring his special sacrifice but is atoned for by the communal "sacrifice of forgetfulness" bull. Just as the court is only liable if it negates a part of a commandment, but not the whole commandment, so too the High Priest.<br />
