The Kohanim then will know not to marry her, and other people, by contrast, will know that she is available. <br/> <br/> Part of the procedure is for her to remove his shoe. The shoe should be proper, made from leather, and fit to be worn. As an enhancement, they add a strap to the shoe, so that that the two actions - untying the strap, and the removing the shoe - leave no doubt in the validity of the procedure. <br/> <br/> Rabbi Yannai asked, "What if she tore the shoe of his foot, or burned it off his foot? Do we need the foot to become exposed - and that is achieved - or do we need proper removal?" - To this there was no answer. <br/> <br/> Art: The New Shoe by Elizabeth Nourse</body></html>
