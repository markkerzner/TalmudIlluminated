What is his logic? - The Torah said, " <a href = "null">Speak to the Levites and say to them, 'When you take â€¦ tithe.'</a> " <br/> <br/> However, Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah says that the tithe goes to the Kohanim. How could he exclude the Levites altogether? - He didn't, he meant "Also to the Kohanim." And what is his logic? - There are twenty-four places where the Kohanim are called Levites, because they in fact come from the same family: Aaron, the progenitor of all the Kohanim, comes from the tribe of Levy. <br/> <br/> If so, how can Rabbi Akiva argue that the tithe should not be given to the Kohanim? - He says that the tithe is special, because one can eat it " <a href = "null">anywhere</a> ," whereas the Kohen cannot eat it in a cemetery - because he cannot go to the cemetery at all! What would Rabbi Elazar answer now? - He says that this teaches a different law, namely, that the tithe can be eaten in any state, even being ritually impure. <br/> <br/> Later, when the Second Temple was being build, the Sages penalized the Levites and took the tithe away from them and gave it to the Kohanim - because the Levites did not come back to build the Temple; some say, it was done for the benefit of poor Kohanim. <br/> <br/> Rabbi Elazar ben Azaryah had a garden from which he was collecting the tithe. Rabbi Akiva turned the garden's entrance into a cemetery, so that Rabbi Elazar (who was a Kohen) would be prevented from taking the tithe. Rabbi Elazar said, "Akiva is with his shepherd's sack, but I will survive anyway." (He was very wealthy). <br/> <br/> Art: Old Cemetery Tower At Nuenen by Vincent Van Gogh</body></html>
