Therefore, if he marries and dies childless, there is a question of who should do yibum with his widow. The answer is that both sets of brothers have to give her a chalitzah, because he may have been their full brother, and she is therefore part of the family. <br/> <br/> However, nobody can do a yibum with her. That is because he may have been only from the same mother, but not from their father, in which case his widow is forbidden as a former wife of their brother, while the mitzvah of yibum exists does not apply, because it is only for paternal brothers. <br/> <br/> Art: Dressing The Baby by Jacob Simon Hendrik Kever</body></html>
