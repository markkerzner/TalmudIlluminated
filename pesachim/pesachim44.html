Rav Dimi answered him, "Yes." Abaye started attacking this statement. 
<br />
<br />
Take, for example, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2013/08/pesachim-42-unwanted-substances.html">Babylonian sour dip</a> we had above, which was not prohibited by the Torah and was only removed as a precaution? Rav Dimi answered, "Forget Babylonian sour dip, where the concentration of bread is not sufficient to reach an olive's bulk in normal eating." 
<br />
<br />
This dip is meant to be eaten as a condiment. When one eats it in this way, he does not reach the olive's bulk of bread in the normal period of eating, and so he is not liable from the Torah point of view. Now, if he decides to gulp the dip, then he is not eating like people normally eat, and this is not considered an act of eating - and Torah only prohibits eating chametz, not swallowing it in an abnormal way.
<br />
<br />
Abaye asked more questions, comparing this to the laws of a nazirite who decides to soak his bread in wine, to meat cooked in milk, and to milk in which meat was cooked, but Rav Dimi was able to answer all of them, so in the end one cannot mix bread into his food and eat it on Passover.
