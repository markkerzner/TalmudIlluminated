One may sell an ox or a horse just before Shabbat, the buyer may then ask to demonstrate the animalâ€™s prowess, and the Jew would spur it on with his voice, thus causing the animal to work on Shabbat. (This prohibition is not in force today). <br/> <br/> Going together with it, some communities adopted a prohibition not to sell small livestock - so that one does not come to sell large livestock. Others say that the prohibition was added to prevent sodomy. However, this is a kind of custom that was not generally adopted, and one is not obligated to conform to it, even in a city where everyone else does so. <br/> <br/> In a similar vein, in some places people had a custom to light a candle in a house on the night of Yom Kippur, and in some - not to light it. Both, however, intended for the good: those who lighted did so to prevent cohabitation on Yom Kippur, since in general it is prohibited with the light of a candle. Those who did not light did so in order not to see the beauty of the spouse and not to be aroused by it. <br/> <br/> Art: A Lady Admiring An Earring by Candlelight by Godfried Schalcken</body></html>
