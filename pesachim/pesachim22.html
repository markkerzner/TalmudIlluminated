Where does it say so in the Torah? - The words "It will not be eaten" are understood to mean, "You shall not do anything with it that can lead to eating."
<br />
<br />
That, actually, is a general rule. Any time something "will not be eaten," it is really prohibited for all use - these are the words of Chizkiyah. Rav Abahu says that the rule is even more general: anything about which the Torah says, "do not eat it" is additionally prohibited for all benefit.
<br />
<br />
Where does Rav Abahu get his additional stringency? - From the rule about meat not slaughtered properly. Since such meat can be "given as a present to a non-Jewish resident in Israel or be sold to a non-Jew," we understand that in all other cases "do not eat" means "and donâ€™t use or sell."
<br />
<br />
The Talmud offers many challenges to both Chizkiyah and Rav Abahu. For example, the sciatic nerve (think filet mignon) cannot be eaten, but it can be sold to a non-Jewish butcher. Why is the benefit permitted in this case? - They will answer that it is an exception, since this nerve was permitted for benefit together with the meat that was not slaughtered properly. Other cases intended to disprove them similarly end up being exceptions and special cases.
