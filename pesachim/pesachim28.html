The Sages disagree and say to him, "You sound stringent here, but this will lead to a great leniency later on: if one does not have firewood, what is he to do?" Rabbi Yehudah then tried to prove his point of view to the Sages by comparing chametz to various offerings that must burned, but was ultimately disproved by contradictions with his earlier statements. The Talmud then applies a proverb, "The arrow maker was killed by his own arrow" to him.
<br />
<br />
The next rule about chametz is that if a non-Jew owned it during Passover, then afterward it is permitted to use, but if a Jew owned it on Passover, then afterward it is forever forbidden for use, because of the phrase, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=13#P1875">no leaven must be seen in your territories</a>." 
<br />
<br />
This rule is strange according to whichever view you take. Rabbi Yose allows the use of chametz on Passover itself! Rabbi Shimon forbids it only during Passover, but not after. And Rabbi Yehudah, who is the strictest, should forbid any chametz that existed on Passover, regardless of who owned it. Thus, there seems to be no place for our rule, which forbids only chametz that was owned on Passover by a Jew.
