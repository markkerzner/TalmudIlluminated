One should not drink water in the dark from ponds at night, because the demon by the name of Shavrirei may be found in this water.  What if one is thirsty? - If he has someone with him, he should say to him friend, "I, the son of so-and-so, am thirsty." If he has no one with him, she should said, "I, am the son of so-and-so (talking about himself), and my mother said to me, 'Beware of shavrirei, shavrirei, vrirei, rirei, irei, rei', and I am thirsty for water in new earthenware cups."
<br />
<br />
Going back to the Seder, even a poor person who is supported from the communal kitchen is obligated to drink four cups of wine at the Seder. But this is obvious, since very Jew has to do mitzvot!? - True, but this is only needed because of the teaching of Rabbi Akiva that one should make his Shabbat like a weekday, but never depend on other people - even according to his opinion one should beg, borrow, or be provided. 
<br />
<br />
Actually, Rabbi Akiva gave his son seven instructions, the one above and six more, some of which are "don't live in the city where a  Sage is a mayor (because he will be engrossed in study and neglect the city)," "never enter even your own house suddenly, without giving an audible warning" and "engage in business with one who is enjoying good fortune (because his good luck may rub off on you)." The latter, however, is true only for partnership, but not to buy and sell from him - for he will get a better deal. 
<br />
<br />
Later, Rabbi Chanina met with the queen of demons, Agrat bat Machlat, and banned her from appearing to people. She asked for some reprieve, and he gave her Tuesdays and Fridays, but then Abaye banished demons altogether. The Talmud interjects, "But we do see them sometimes!" - and answers that these are stragglers.
