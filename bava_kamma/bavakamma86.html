        <br/> If one injures his fellow, but it is clear that the wound will heal, he pays for the loss of employment.
        Does he also pay damages for the temporary reduction in value?<br/> <br />
        Can we derive the answer from this ruling: "One who strikes his father but doesn't inflict a wound is obligated in five payments?" <br /><br />First of all, this is strange in itself. If he wounds his father, he is liable to death penalty, and therefore he does not pay!? - Let us say we are dealing with the situation where he shaved his father's head. Since five payments include temporary reduction in value, and yet he pays all of them, does this not prove that he always pays for temporary reduction in value? - No, this is not a full proof! Perhaps here he made his father bald with a depilatory cream, and his father used to dance in taverns. So the hair will not grow back, and this represents a permanent injury, not temporary. Nothing can be proved from here.
        <br/> <br />One who humiliates a blind or a sleeping person is liable, but a sleeping person person that humiliated someone is not liable. In sum, one is not liable for humiliation unless he <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=25#P5553">intends to injure</a>.<br /><br />
