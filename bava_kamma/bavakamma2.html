For example, a man is responsible in full for even accidental damage, while the owner of an ox is liable for half the damage the first three times; a fire isn't alive; and a pit doesn't move around. <br/> <br/> However, since they can all damage, the owner is responsible to watch over them and to pay damages from the choicest land.</body></html>
