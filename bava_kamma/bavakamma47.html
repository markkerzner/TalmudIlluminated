But if he brought his pots with the homeowner's permission and they were broken, the owner of the courtyard is liable. <br/> <br/> The same laws are true if one brought his produce into a courtyard, and an animal ate it or was harmed by it. <br/> Rebbi says: "The homeowner is not liable unless he explicitly accepts the obligation to guard it." <br/> <br/></body></html>
