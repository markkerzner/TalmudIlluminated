Since he knew that using inferior dye would result in inferior product, he is a damager. His claim to compensation is that he did in fact increase the value. <br/> <br/> If he was to dye red, and he dyed black, Rabbi Meir says that he pays the value of wool, but Rabbi Yehudah awards the claim as above. <br/> <br/> <br/></body></html>
