Or, perhaps that improvement is not considered something material, and thus he is returning only the wool but not the dye - which has in effect disappeared? <br/> The question is relevant when the dyed wool became cheap. Does the thief have to pay for the dye? Talmud doesn't resolve the question. <br/></body></html>
