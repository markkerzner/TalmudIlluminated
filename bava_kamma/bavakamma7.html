        If one somehow damages his fellow's property, he 
        <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=22#P2116">must make restitution with the best of his field and the best of his vineyard.</a><br/> <br/>
        However, a big question still remains, whose best land is it? 
        Does "his" here mean the one who did the damage, or does it mean the one who suffered this damage?<br/> <br/> 
        Rabbi Ishmael argues that since we just spoke about "another person's field," it must be that we continue talking about the same person,
        that is, the damaged party. The offender should give him land equal in quality to the damaged party's land. <br/> <br/>
        But Rabbi Akiba objects saying that "he must pay" is the clearest indication that we are talking about the one who
        is responsible for the damage. Thus, restitution is from the damaging party's best land.<br/> <br/> 
        
        Eventually, it turns out that money or valuables are also acceptable as payment. If so, when is the law of "the best land" even 
        applicable, if the damager can choose what he wants to give? - It is only important when he pays against his will, that is
        if the court collects his land as payment.<br/> <br/>
