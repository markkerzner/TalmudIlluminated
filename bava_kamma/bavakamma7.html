Why? Just as another man's field (mentioned before) was that of the damaged party, so too the payment is measured by the quality of the damaged party's land. <br/> <br/> And Rabbi Akiba says: "'...he shall pay his choicest field...'" clearly means - with the choicest field of the one who is paying." <br/> <br/> Money or valuables are also acceptable.</body></html>
