The house owner needs to take an oath about the value, and has to be reasonably expected to have such items. <br/> <br/> One is liable for direct or immediate damages but not indirect or delayed ones. <br/> <br/> If a camel laden with flax passed through the street and its flax protruded into a shop and was ignited by the shopkeeper's lamp and set fire to a large towner, the owner of the camel is liable; if the shopkeeper put his lamp outside, the shopkeeper is liable. Rabbi Yehuda says that for Hanukkah light he is not liable. <br/> <br/></body></html>
