And the Rabbis? The slave IS your brother in (some) commandments. Then can the slave testify in court? No, since the slave is similar to a woman and a minor, who also observe some commandments, yet can't testify in court. <br/> <br/> A wife can bequeath her possessions to her son, out of the husband's reach. However, in Usha it was enacted that the husband gets back the usufruct property bequeathed or sold by his wife. <br/></body></html>
