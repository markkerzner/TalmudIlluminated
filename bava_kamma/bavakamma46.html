    If an ox gored a pregnant cow, its owner needs to pay for the damages. However, since oxen usually don't gore, the owner's liability is limited to half the damages. If the calf is found dead next to the cow, then there are two possibilities: it was born before goring and died or itself, or it was a miscarriage due to goring. Since there are two sides to the argument, we split the money they argue about; and since the amount of penalty is only half the damages, the ox's owner pays the quarter of the calf's cost. 
    <br /><br />
    The approach of dividing the money that is left in doubt is advocated by Sumchos, who always divides the money in half in cases of doubt. The Sages think differently: there is another principle, the one seeking to exact payment from his fellow bears the burden of proof. And since the plaintiff, whose calf is dead, cannot prove that it died because of goring, he cannot extract the money from the defendant, who therefore pays nothing for the calf.

    A reverse case is when a pregnant cow gored an ox. The situation is the same: a dead calf is found nearby, but the tables are turned. If the cow was pregnant when goring, the calf was also part of goring, and its cost is included in the damages to the ox. How so? Although the cow was not in a habit of goring, and its owner's liability is limited to half the damage, still he does not pay more than the cost of the cow itself. So if the calf was inside, its cost is included in the upper limit, and if not, then not. As above, Sumchos and the Sages disagree if the cost of the calf is divided or if the claimant has to prove his claim.
