Ox has the intent to damage, whereas fire does not. However a man is liable even for damage which he inflicts while sleeping. Thus, the intent to damage is not essential. <br/> <br/> Man is liable for four damage payments, but fire for just one. However, the ox disproves that, since it is also liable for just one payment. <br/> <br/> Man and ox are alive, and fire is not, thus liability for fire had to be mentioned in the Torah.</body></html>
