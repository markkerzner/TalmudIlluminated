They argue if " <a href = "http://bible.cc/leviticus/24-17.htm">all human life</a> " means any or all of it. <br/> <br/> If one places a jug in the public domain and another comes and stumbles and breaks it, the pedestrian is not liable. If the pedestrian was damaged by it, the owner of the jug is liable.</body></html>
