        Bava Kamma 73 - How far back are lawless witnesses disqualified?<br/><br/>

A false witness bears his punishment; moreover, we find out that he is a lawless person. Therefore, his other court testimonies are disqualified as well. 
<br/><br/>
        How far does it go? Say he testified falsely in April, but was found false in May. Since his bad act was done in April, he is considered lawless from this time. All his April testimonies are now invalid, because one should not <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=23">join forces with a wicked person to be a corrupt witness.</a>" In effect, he becomes lawless retroactively. That is what Abaye indeed holds.
<br/><br/>
However, Rava counters that the law of false witnesses is an exception to logic. Namely, if two people testify about something, and then two more people come and say that the first two were with them in another place at the time of the event - then we believe the last two, and consider the first two false witnesses. Since this is an innovation of the Torah and not common sense, we consider the false witness lawless only from the time that he was declared so, that is, from May.

        Who wins? In this case, Abaye, and
        this is the "A" of the six cases abbreviated 
        <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava_metzia/bavametzia21.html">Y</a>
        <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava_kamma/bavakamma73.html">A</a>
        <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/eruvin/eruvin15.html">L</a> 
        <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/kiddushin/kiddushin51.html">K</a> 
        <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/gittin/gittin34.html">G</a>
        <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin27.html">M</a> 
        where the law follows Abaye against Rava.
        <br/><br/>
        The Talmud continue with this question: if the witnesses testify about stealing an ox and then selling it, 
        and are found false about the first fact, then their testimony about the second fact should not even be accepted. If so, why is the rule that they pay five oxen?
