To make the owner of a goring ox liable to redemption payment for the killing of a woman as for a man? No, it is already written: "... <a href = "null">if an ox shall gore a man or a woman</a> ..."   <br/> Rather, to equate a woman with a man in damages: if a man dies before collecting, his damages go to his heirs, so too a woman - her damages go to her heirs and not to her husband - because the husband inherits only the actual assets that the wife possessed at the time of her death.</body></html>
