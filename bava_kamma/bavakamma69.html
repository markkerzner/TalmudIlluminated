The thief can't consecrate it because it is not his, and the owner can't consecrate it because it is not in his possession." <br/> <br/> But what would be Rabbi Yochanan's source, being that there are Mishnas that rule otherwise? <br/> <br/> His source is another Misha: One who steals a stolen item from a thief does not pay twofold payment. Why not? He doesn't pay the original owner a twofold payment because the article is not the owner's possessions - by the same token the owner can't consecrate it. <br/> <br/> <br/></body></html>
