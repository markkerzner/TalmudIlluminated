        As we mentioned, if one somehow damages his fellow's property, he 
        <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=22#P2116">must make restitution with the best of his field and the best of his vineyard.</a><br/><br/>
        Imagine, however, that all his lands are so excellent that even his worst land 
            is still better than the world's average best land. Does he still have to
            give his best land, or does it suffice to give the world's best land, which is 
            actually his worst land? Keep in mind that the question is not relevant to 
        Rabbi Ishmael above, who in any case measures by the damaged party's land. 
        But what would Rabbi Akiva say?
        <br/> <br/>
            The Talmud tries to resolve the question by comparing it to related ruling, but then proves that these
        ruling are not really related. So we don't find an answer, but meanwhile we discover
        an interesting principle about loans. Here it is.<br/><br/>
        Logically speaking, a creditor should only get the worst land when he collects a debt. The Torah says about a debt collector that he cannot enter the debtor's house but should stand outside, and be happy with the collateral that the debtor will bring him. And what will he bring? - Naturally the worst!<br/><br/>
        However, the Sages saw that then nobody will be willing to give loans, so they
        fixes the law and made the debtor give his medium quality land. That is Ulla's explantion. Some people do not agree to it though.
