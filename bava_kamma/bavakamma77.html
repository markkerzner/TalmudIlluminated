Rabbi Shimon maintains that even after the red heifer was slaughtered on its pyre, it may be redeemed if a nicer heifer is found. <br/> <br/> Similarly, if the thief slaughtered a stolen blemished offering outside the Temple, he is liable to the fourfold or fivefold payment - since that animal could be redeemed and eaten. <br/> <br/> <br/></body></html>
