There are three ways to understand this: <br/> <br/> 1. One can pay with bran only if he has no money and no land; <br/> 2. One can pay with bran only if he doesn't have money; <br/> 3. One can pay with bran even if he has money, and if he has no money or movables left, then he needs to pay with superior land.</body></html>
