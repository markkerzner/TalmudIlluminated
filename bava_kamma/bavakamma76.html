If one stole an ox or a sheep, then consecrated it to the Temple, and then slaughtered or sold it, he pays the double payment for his theft but doesn't pay the five oxen for an ox or four sheep for a sheep.
<br /><br />
Why not? Usually, one who steals and slaughters an ox pays five oxen in return! Granted, when he slaughters it, it is the property of the Temple, not of the original owner. But when he consecrates it, let this be the equivalent of a sale of a stolen animal to the Temple! Thus he stole and then sold, and that is precisely when he pays five oxen!? No, that logic is incorrect! Consecration differs from a sale: after consecration, the animal is still called "A sacrifice of so-and-so," not a "sacrifice of the Temple."
