If he slapped him on his cheek, he gives him 200 zuz ($10,000), if he did it with the back of his hand, 400 zuz. <br/> <br/> If he pulled his ear, yanked his hair, spat on him and his spittle reached him, removed his cloak from him, or bared the head of a woman in the marketplace, he gives him (or her) 400 zuz ($20,000). <br/> <br/> This is the general rule: Everything depends on the victim's level of honor, and the amount above are the maximum. <br/> <br/></body></html>
