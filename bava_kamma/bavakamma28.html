The other one stopped him with a stick. <br/> <br/> Rav Yehudah says that a person may not enforce the law for himself, but Rav Nachman says that he may. They argue about a case where there will be no loss if he does not take action. <br/> <br/> Rav Yehudah explains: "Since there will be no loss, let him go before the judge." Rav Nachman says: "Since he is acting in accordance with the law, he does not have to trouble himself and go before the judge."</body></html>
