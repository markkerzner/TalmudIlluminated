They include <br/> * Worshipers read from the Torah scroll during the Minchah service on the Sabbath; * They read from the Torah on Monday and Thursday; * The courts adjudicate on Monday and Thursday; * The people launder on Thursday to honor the Sabbath; * People should eat garlic on Friday night, because it increases the semen; * A woman shall rise early on Friday morning and bake, so that bread would be available to the poor; * Peddlers of perfumes shall circulate in towns to make adornments available to women. <br/> <br/></body></html>
