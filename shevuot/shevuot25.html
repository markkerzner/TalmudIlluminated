<span style="font-size: medium;">An
 oath takes effect regarding both matters relevant to oneself and 
relevant to another, regarding both matters of substance and those 
lacking substance.<br>
<br>
For example, if one swears &#8220;I will give something to so-and-so&#8221; or &#8220;I 
will not give it to him,&#8221; or &#8220;I swear that I gave it to him&#8221; or &#8220;I swear
 that I did not give it to him,&#8221; - this is an oath about others.<br>
<br>
If he said, &#8220;I swear that I will sleep&#8221; or &#8220;that I will not sleep,&#8221; &#8220;I 
slept&#8221; or &#8220;I did not sleep&#8221; - these are oaths concerning intangible 
matters.<br>
<br>
If one said, &#8220;I swear that I will throw a pebble into the sea&#8221; or &#8220;I 
will not throw the pebble,&#8221; &#8220;I threw the pebble&#8221; or &#8220;I did not throw&#8221; - 
these are oaths concerning non-beneficial acts.<br>
