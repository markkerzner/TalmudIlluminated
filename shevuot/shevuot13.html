<span style="font-size: medium;">The goat 
sacrifice, whose blood is brought inside the Holy of Holies, atones for 
all transgressions related to ritual purity, whether performed by 
mistake or deliberately. The goat that is sent away atones for all sins,
 whether done by mistake or deliberately &#8211; provided that the person 
repents. Greater than this is the day of Yom Kippur itself, which atones
 for all transgressions between man and God, again, provided that the 
man repents.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Yehudah the Prince has an exceptional opinion that Yom Kippur 
atones even for the person who does not repent (with three exceptions: 
denying the existence of Creator, speaking insolently of  the Torah, and
 refusing to be circumcised).  But according to Rabbi Yehudah, how is it
 at all possible to deserve being cut off &#8211; which <a href="http://scripturetext.com/leviticus/23-29.htm">the Torah promises 
for eating and working on Yom Kippur</a> - if the last moment of it 
effects atonement? - It would apply to one who who eats, chokes, and 
immediately dies in the middle of Yom Kuppur, or alternatively to one 
who keeps eating at the end of Yom Kuppur.<br>
