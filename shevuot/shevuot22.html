<span style="font-size: medium;">Asked Rava, &#8220;If 
one took an oath not to eat earth, how much must he eat to be liable?&#8221; 
Is it like all eating, a volume of an olive, or, since earth is 
inedible, he means even a minute amount? - Remains unresolved.<br>
<br>
If one swore, &#8220;An oath that I will not eat,&#8221; and then he ate and drank, 
he is liable to only one offering. But if one swore, &#8220;An oath that I 
will not eat and that I will not drink,&#8221; and then he ate and drank, he 
is liable to two offerings.<br>
<br>
If one swore, &#8220;An oath that I will not eat,&#8221; and then he ate prohibited 
foods, such as animals or foul that were not slaughtered correctly, 
unkosher fish, seals, frogs, flies, bees, mosquitoes &#8211; he is liable. 
Rabbi Shimon exempts him, because he swore to something to which he is 
already obligated, and his new oath did not take effect.<br>
