<span style="font-size: medium;">One is liable for
 entering the Temple while impure, whether he enters the original 
Courtyard or the area that was added later &#8211; and here is the procedure 
for adding to the Courtyard and to the City of Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
With the consent of the king, a prophet, Urim VeTumim, and the Sanhedrin
 of seventy one, they would prepare a Thanksgiving offering and a song. 
The High Court marches around the perimeter of the area being added, and
 the two loaves of the Thanksgiving offering in front of them &#8211; carried 
by the kohanim &#8211; and all Israel behind them. The Thanksgiving  loaves 
were used because they can only be eaten inside of Jerusalem, and they 
were very large, made with a few hundred cups of flour. They sang &#8220;<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26a0.htm">The Song of 
Thanksgiving, call out to God everyone on earth.</a>&#8221;, accompanied by 
harps, lyres, and cymbals.<br>
