<span style="font-size: medium;">If
 one adjured the witnesses five times outside the court, and they denied
 knowing testimony, and then they came to court and admitted that they 
did know the testimony, they are not liable at all. A denial issued 
outside a court is not legally significant. However, if they denied 
knowing testimony in court, they are liable for each and every time they
 were adjured. Their single denial applies to each adjuration 
separately, and thus they are liable to bring five offerings.<br>
<br>
If he adjured them five times, this time in court, and they denied 
knowing testimony in court, they are liable for only one oath. Rabbi 
Shimon explained, &#8220;Why? Because, after denying knowledge of the 
testimony in court, they cannot retract and confess that they do know 
the testimony.&#8221; Their denial in court of knowing testimony is itself 
treated as testimony, and the rule is that once witnesses give testimony
 in court they can never retract of alter that testimony. Therefore, for
 the last four oaths they are no longer eligible to give testimony.<br>
