<span style="font-size: medium;">If
 one lends his fellow money on collateral, he is considered a paid 
guardian of this collateral. Therefore, should the collateral be lost or
 stolen, the lender is liable for it. If the collateral was worth more 
than the loan, the lender must pay the balance to the borrower, and if 
it was worth less than the loan, the borrower pays the balance to the 
lender. <br>
<br>
If the borrower claims that the collateral was worth the amount of his 
loan, and the lender says that it was less, the borrower is free from an
 oath, since there was no admission of partial liability. However, if 
the borrower says that he owes a balance, and the lender says that he 
owes a larger balance, the borrower has to swear. <br>
<br>
Who swears as to the value of the collateral? The one in whose 
possession it was lost, or the lender. If the borrower were to swear and
 not be careful in assessing the value, and the lender would later 
produce the deposit, the borrower would be disqualified from taking 
oaths and from testifying in court. This would be unfair, so the Sages 
shifted the oath to the lender.<br>
