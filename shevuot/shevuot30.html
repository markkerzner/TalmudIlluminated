<span style="font-size: medium;">The
 oath of testimony concerns witnesses who knew testimony that a litigant
 needs in order to win a monetary case. If the litigant asks them to 
testify, and they falsely swear that they do not know the testimony, 
they are liable to bring a &#8220;variable&#8221; offering when they admit that they
 lied. If the litigant has other means to win the case, or he has other 
witnesses, the liability for false oath does not apply.<br>
<br>
In addition to making a personal oath, one can answer &#8220;Amen&#8221; to someone 
saying &#8220;I adjure you,&#8221; and this also becomes an oath, as if he said it 
himself. In the case of the oath of testimony, if one repeats in court 
that he does not know the testimony, after being adjured, this also 
becomes an oath.<br>
