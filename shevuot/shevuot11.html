<span style="font-size: medium;">When an object is
 donated or consecrated to the Temple, it attains sanctity and should 
not be used for one's own needs. Consecrated objects can be redeemed 
with money, and the sanctity transfers to money. Higher than this is 
physical sanctity: if the consecrated object can be used in the Temple 
service &#8211; for example if it is an animal fit for the Alter, wine, flour,
 or incense &#8211; then it cannot, as a rule, be redeemed.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, Ulla said in the name of Rabbi Yochanan that daily 
offerings that are not needed by the community can be redeemed. There 
were four such lambs at the end of each Temple's fiscal year, when new 
half-shekels began to be used. <br>
<br>
Here is the procedure. The Temple treasurer borrows some funds, which 
are thus completely unconsecrated. He redeems the lambs, transferring 
their holiness to the money. This money is then added to the old 
half-shekels and is used for plating the Holy of Holies. The treasurer 
then repurchases the lambs with new half-shekels. Where does their 
holiness go? The court makes it a condition when consecrating the lambs 
in the first place that if they are not needed, they can be redeemed.<br>
