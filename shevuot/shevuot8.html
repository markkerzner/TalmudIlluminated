<span style="font-size: medium;">There are seven 
sins that lead to Tsara'at: talking badly about others, bloodshed, vain 
oath, forbidden unions, haughtiness, robbery, and stinginess.<br>
<br>
The goat brought on Yom Kippur suspends one's punishment for going to 
the Temple while impure. But if it does not erase it completely, how 
does the suspension help? Rav Zeira said, &#8220;By suspension, we mean that 
if the sinner dies before becoming aware of his transgression, he dies 
without this sin on his record.&#8221; <br>
<br>
Said Rava to Rav Zeira, &#8220;The sinner does not need the goat sacrifice for
 this, for if he dies, then death itself purges him of his sin!&#8221; Rather,
 Rava said, &#8220;The purpose of suspension is to shield him from the 
suffering he deserves on account of his sin, until he becomes aware of 
it and gains complete atonement thorough his offering.&#8221;<br>
