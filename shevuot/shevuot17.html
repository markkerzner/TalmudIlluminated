<span style="font-size: medium;">If one became 
ritually impure while in the Temple and </span><span style="font-size: medium;">before leaving</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> bowed 
down, or tarried long enough to bow down, he is liable to the &#8220;variable&#8221;
 offering. <br>
<br>
There are three kinds of bowing down are mentioned in the Scripture. 
&#8220;Kidah&#8221; means bringing one's face down to the ground from a standing 
position, with no more than his thumbs to support him in front. <a href="http://bible.cc/1_kings/1-31.htm">Batsheva was able to do it</a>, 
and the High Priest would attempt it on Yom Kippur in order to keep 
awake. &#8220;Keriah&#8221; is kneeling down, and &#8220;Hishtachavaah&#8221; means complete 
prostration on the ground, with arms and legs extended.<br>
<br>
Rava asked, &#8220;If one, upon being contaminated, suspended himself in the 
air of the Courtyard, not touching the floor, is he liable for an 
offering?&#8221; Does &#8220;tarrying long enough to bow down&#8221; imply being able to 
actually bow down, or does it not? - No answer is given to that 
question.<br>
