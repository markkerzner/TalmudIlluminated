<span style="font-size: medium;">According to 
Rabbi Yehudah, both the goats brought on Festivals and the goats brought
 on the New Moon atone for such violations of ritual purity laws of 
which one never becomes aware.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Shimon disagrees about the goats of New Moon and says that these 
atone specifically for cases when one, while being pure, inadvertently 
eats sacrifices that are impure.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Meir says that the atonement of all he-goats is the same: they 
atone for inadvertent purity violations of the Temple and of its 
offerings.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Shimon ben Yehuda has a different version of what Rabbi Shimon 
said: that the goats atone for progressively wider range of 
infringements, in order from New Moon to Festivals to Yom Kippur. Said 
the Sages to him, &#8220;If they are so similar, can a goat designated for the
 New Moon be brought on Yom Kippur ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes. Even though they 
are not the same, they have that in common that they deal with purity of
 the Temple and its offerings.&#8221;<br>
