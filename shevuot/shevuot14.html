<span style="font-size: medium;">If a person 
touched an object that made him impure, forgot about it, and then 
knowingly ate sacrifices, he has to bring a &#8220;variable&#8221; offering that 
depends on his means. This case is explicitly mentioned in the Torah. 
However, if he remembered about his impurity but forgot that the food he
 was eating was holy, he is equally liable, only this case in not 
mentioned in the Torah but is rather derived.<br>
<br>
Similarly, if he forgot about his impurity and visited the Temple, this 
is the second of the &#8220;two&#8221; cases mentioned in the Torah. If he 
remembered about the impurity but forgot about the Temple, this is the 
additional derived case.<br>
<br>
Asked Rav Pappa, what if he forgot about the laws of impurity?  - But 
what exactly did he forget? If he forgot if it is a lizard or a frog 
that makes him impure &#8211; let him go and learn it with the children in 
school! Rather, what if he forgot the amount of lizard's meat that makes
 him impure on contact, is it like a lentil or more, what is the law? - 
This question remains unresolved.<br>
