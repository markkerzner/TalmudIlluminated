<span style="font-size: medium;">Occasionally
 the Talmud puts in mnemonics for those who are committing it to memory.
 They are also keys to a deeper meaning. This mnemonic is for the four 
of the thirteen teachings that can be derived from the phrase &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/23-7.htm">Distance yourself from falsehood</a>,&#8221; and here they are<br>
<br>
* A judge should not defend his opinion about which he has doubts, merely to avoid embarrassment; <br>
* He should not have an ignorant student assist him in judgment;<br>
* He should not join another judge whom he knows to be a thief; <br>
* If he has discerned that the witnesses are lying, he should not 
continue to judge, internally putting the blame on the witnesses; <br>
* A student assisting a judge who sees an argument in favor of a poor man should not be silent about it; <br>
* If a student sees his teacher making a mistake, he should not wait 
till the teacher concludes the judgment, for the student to demolish it 
and get honor; <br>
* If a teacher tells his student &#8220;You know me, I won't lie. Someone owes
 me a maneh ($5,000), but I have only one witness &#8211; please be the second
 one&#8221; - the student should not be a witness;<br>
* Six more...<br>
