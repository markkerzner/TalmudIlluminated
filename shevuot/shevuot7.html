<span style="font-size: medium;">If one knew that 
he was ritually impure, forgot about it and then visited the Temple or 
ate sacrifices, once he remembers his impurity &#8211; he is obligated to 
bring a &#8220;variable&#8221; sacrifice, the nature of which depends on his means.<br>
<br>
If, however, he never recalls that he was impure, the goat that is 
brought as a sacrifice on Yom Kippur, and the day of Yom Kippur itself, 
suspends his punishment. When he finally does find out about his past 
impurity, he then brings a &#8220;variable sacrifice.&#8221;<br>
<br>
But maybe the goat of Yom Kippur atones even for idol worship, 
prohibited relations, and bloodshed, because these are also 
characterized as &#8220;impure&#8221;? - No! Yom Kippur atones only &#8220;from impurities
 of the Children of Israel,&#8221; but not all impurities &#8211; these are the 
words of Rabbi Yehudah. Rabbi Shimon derives the same answer from the 
context of Yom Kippur &#8211; it atones only for matters related to the Temple
 service.<br>
