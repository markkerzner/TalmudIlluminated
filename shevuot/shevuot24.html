<span style="font-size: medium;">When
 one eats meat of an animal that was not properly slaughtered (neveilah)
 on Yom Kippur, this is an example of an inclusive prohibition. This 
meat was already prohibited to him before Yom Kippur. Now that Yom 
Kippur came, it brought with itself an all-inclusive prohibition to eat 
this and other foods. The Sages make him liable for two prohibitions: 
eating unkosher meat and eating on Yom Kippur. Rabbi Shimon, however, 
does not agree to the principle of inclusive prohibition and makes him 
liable only for eating unkosher meat.<br>
<br>
However, what about the following ruling: for an act of eating one can 
be liable to five offerings: an impure person who ate forbidden fat 
usually brought on the altar, beyond the time allowed for the sacrifice,
 from consecrated animal, and on Yom Kippur. According to the principle 
of inclusive prohibition, why not add another one &#8211; an oath against 
eating fat? - We list only those prohibitions that existed by 
themselves, not the ones he creates.<br>
