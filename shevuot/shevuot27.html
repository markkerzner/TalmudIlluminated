<span style="font-size: medium;">If
 one swears to violate a mitzvah but does not violate it &#8211; he is not 
liable for an oath of utterance and a sacrifice. In the same way, if he 
swears to fulfill a mitzvah and does not do it, he is exempt. Oaths only
 apply to something that he has freedom to do or not to do, and not to 
mitzvot, which one is obligated to do from the time of Mount Sinai. 
However, in the first case he is liable to lashes for making a vain 
oath.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Yehudah ben Beteira wants to prove that one who swears to do a 
mitzvah and does not do it is liable, as follows. If in the case of an 
oath to do an optional act one is liable for not doing it, then in the 
case of a mitzvah, which he is already obligated to do, how much more so
 is he liable if he does not do it!<br>
<br>
But the Sages say, oaths are only created if one has freedom to promise 
to do or not to do, and in the case of mitzvot one does not have this 
freedom.<br>
