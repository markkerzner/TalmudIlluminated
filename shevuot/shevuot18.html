<span style="font-size: medium;">If one was 
cohabiting with a woman, and she told him &#8220;I have become a niddah&#8221; (that
 is, she sensed during the cohabitation that she has begun to 
menstruate), and he withdrew immediately (with a &#8220;live&#8221; organ 
[erection]) &#8211; he is liable to a sacrifice, since his exit is as 
pleasurable to him as his entry.<br>
<br>
Therefore, as Abaye said, he is liable to two offerings. But, as Rava 
asked, how could it be two offerings? If he is a Sage, and he knows the 
rules, then he may liable to bring an offering for the entry, but as far
 as exit &#8211; he is doing it deliberately, and offerings are brought only 
for mistakes! And if he is an ignoramus, this is all one big mistake, 
and he brings one offering! Rava himself answered his question, 
explaining that we are dealing with an incomplete Sage, who does not 
know the prohibition to withdraw immediately, which makes it for him an 
unintentional mistake.<br>
<br>
What should he do? He should "thrust his ten fingernails in the ground, 
like Joseph" (remain still until his organ becomes limp) and he is 
fortunate for having conquered his evil inclination.<br>
