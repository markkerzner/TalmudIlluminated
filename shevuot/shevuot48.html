<span style="font-size: medium;">When
 a lender dies, the money that he had loaned out belongs to his 
children. Before collecting, they must take an &#8220;oath of heirs,&#8221; which 
states that to the best of their knowledge the debt was not repaid.<br>
<br>
However, as both Rav and Shmuel have stated, that is only true if the 
lender died first. If, on the other hand, the borrower died first, then 
the lender has to take a definite oath that the debt was not repaid. His
 children cannot take such a definite oath, but only to the best of 
their knowledge, and it is not sufficient. Thus, if their father now 
dies, they cannot collect the money at all.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Elazar in Israel disagreed, &#8220;Just because the lender's children 
cannot take the same oath as him, must they forfeit their father's 
debt?&#8221;<br>
<br>
In practice, the ruling of Rav and Shmuel was followed, but, since there
 was not a definite decision either way, if a judge ruled in accordance 
with Rabbi Elazar, his ruling would also stand.<br>
