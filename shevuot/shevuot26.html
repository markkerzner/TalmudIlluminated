<span style="font-size: medium;">According to Rabbi Ishmael, one is not liable to bring a sacrifice for oaths concerning past events, because of the following: &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-4.htm">If a person swears by uttering with his lips to do bad or to do good</a>...&#8221; - and these oaths are expressed in future terms.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Akiva said to him, &#8220;If so, if you want to interpret the verse 
literally, then you only have oaths dealing with good and bad. What 
about neutral oaths, such as to throw a rock into the sea?&#8221; Rabbi 
Ishmael answered, &#8220;I get it from the extra inclusion of 'for anything 
that a person utters in an oath'&#8221;. Said Rabbi Akiva, &#8220;This inclusion 
also includes oaths concerning the past!&#8221;<br>
<br>
Rabbi Akiva answered well! What does Rabbi Ishmael have to say? The 
teacher of Rabbi Ishmael was Rabbi Nechunia ben Hakaneh, the chief 
kabbalist of the time, and the teacher of Rabbi Akiva was Nachum Ish 
Gamzu, known for saying &#8220;This also is for the good,&#8221; and they differed 
on which of the 13 rules of Torah interpretation is prevalent &#8211; the 
generalization/specification or the amplification/limitation.<br>
