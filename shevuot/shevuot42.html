<span style="font-size: medium;">These
 are things regarding which one need not swear: slaves, notes of 
indebtedness, land, and consecrated property. Incidentally, for these 
things one is not liable to a twofold penalty for theft, nor to  the 
fourfold and fivefold penalty for stealing, killing, and selling an 
animal.<br>
<br>
An unpaid custodian, who ordinarily must swear that he was not negligent
 in guarding an object entrusted in his care, does not have to swear for
 these things. A paid custodian, who is ordinarily liable for theft, 
does not have to swear and does not pay for those things.<br>
<br>
An oath requires a definite measure. For example, if one says, &#8220;I 
delivered a house full of produce to you for safekeeping,&#8221; or &#8220;a purse 
full of money,&#8221; and the guardian says, &#8220;I do not know how much you gave,
 but I am giving you back everything,&#8221; - he does not have to swear. 
However, if he says that the produce reached to the ceiling beam, and 
the guardian says that it only reached the window &#8211; the guardian has to 
swear due to his partial admission.<br>
