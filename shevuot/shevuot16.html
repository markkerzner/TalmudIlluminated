<span style="font-size: medium;">Do we need <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/07/shevuot-oaths-15-adding-to-city-of.html">all
 attributes (king, prophet, etc.)</a> to sanctify additional areas of 
Jerusalem, or are some enough? <br>
<br>
Those who say that a few attributes are sufficient say so because in 
their view the initial holiness of Jerusalem lapsed with the Babylonian 
exile. Since Ezra did not have all the attributes, but was still able to
 sanctify Jerusalem and the Temple, we see that not all attributes are 
needed.<br>
<br>
Those who say that all are required say so because in their view the 
initial holiness of Jerusalem continued through the Babylonian exile. If
 so, then why did Ezra need any sanctification at all? - Just for 
remembrance of the ritual.<br>
<br>
If one became impure while in the Temple and forgot about it, he is 
obligated to bring a &#8220;variable&#8221; offering. This is not mentioned directly
 in the Torah. However, since there are two separate prohibitions to 
enter the Tabernacle and the Temple while being impure, and the words 
Tabernacle and Temple are used interchangeably, the extra prohibition is
 applied to one who becomes impure while in the Courtyard.<br>
