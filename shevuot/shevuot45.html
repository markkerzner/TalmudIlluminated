<span style="font-size: medium;">In
 what circumstances does the victim of a theft swear and collect? The 
witnesses saw a creditor who entered the debtor's house to take 
something as security from him, without his permission. That is 
prohibited by the Torah, and one who takes collateral forcefully is 
considered a thief. The creditor then left with unidentified utensils 
under his cloak. The debtor can swear and collect his utensils. Of 
course, this law also applies to a full-fledged thief.<br>
<br>
Similarly, if witnesses saw that someone entered another's domain whole 
and left injured, then since it is improbable that the victim would 
self-inflict those injuries, he can swear and collect damages.<br>
<br>
What is the case of a storekeeper with his ledger? If an employer tells the storekeeper, &#8220;Give my workers <a href="http://shmsoft.com/view/perm/talmud%20coins.jpg">two selah</a>
 in small change,&#8221; and the shopkeeper says, &#8220;It is written in my ledger 
that I gave as you instructed,&#8221; but the workers say, &#8220;We did not take 
anything from the storekeeper,&#8221; they both swear and collect the payment 
from the employer.<br>
