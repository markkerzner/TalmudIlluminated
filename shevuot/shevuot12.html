 Rabbi Yochanan had stated</a> that daily offerings that are not needed 
by the community can be redeemed. However, Rabbi Shimon disagrees with 
this. In looking for the opponents of Rabbi Shimon, whose view Rabbi 
Yochanan follows, we fail to find an explicit recorded ruling and are 
forced to conclude that Rabbi Yochanan had a tradition from his teachers
 to this effect.<br>
<br>
But according to Rabbi Shimon, what do we do with the leftover lambs? - 
We offer them as treats on the Altar. This agrees with Rabbi Shimon's 
view that offerings of a similar nature (in this case, they are 
burnt-offerings, totally consumed on the Altar) are interchangeable.<br>
