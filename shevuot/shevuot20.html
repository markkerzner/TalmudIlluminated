<span style="font-size: medium;">If one made an 
oath not to eat a certain loaf and then he said regarding another loaf, 
&#8220;This one should be to me like that one,&#8221; - does this create another 
oath? Abaye says &#8220;Yes,&#8221; but Rava says &#8220;No.&#8221;<br>
<br>
They challenged both based on the following ruling. If one says &#8220;It is 
hereby incumbent on me that I not eat meat nor drink wine, as on the day
 on which my father died (source for fasting on a yahrtzeit), or as on 
the day when Gedaliyah ben Achikam was killed (fast of the 3rd of 
Tishrei), or as on the day on which I viewed Jerusalem in its 
destruction&#8221; - he is indeed prohibited; and Shmuel commented on this, 
&#8220;This is only true if he already vowed from that day on.&#8221;<br>
<br>
This seems perfect according to Abaye: one attaches a vow to a vow, and 
in the same way an oath to an oath. However, it does not agree with 
Rava, who said that one cannot attach one oath to another oath! Rava 
will tell you that this ruling discusses a vow attached to a prohibited 
object (meat and wine), not an attachment to a vow, which, although 
mentioned, would be ineffective.<br>
