<span style="font-size: medium;">The goat 
sacrifice brought on New Moon atones for the cases of ritual impurity 
which never become known to the person who was impure. That is why this 
sacrifice is called &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/28-15.htm">a 
sacrifice for God</a>&#8221; - for God alone knows of this impurity - these 
are the words of Rabbi Yehudah.<br>
<br>
Additionally, as Resh Lakish explained, God said, &#8220;This he-goat shall be
 an atonement for something that I did.&#8221; When God created the Sun and 
the Moon, they were initially of the same size. The Moon complained that
 it is not appropriate for two rulers to rule at once, and God said, 
"You are right. Go and make itself smaller." The Moon then reasoned that
 it was unjust that it should suffer just because it raised a valid 
point. In order to placate the Moon, God promised that the Jewish people
 will be bringing a sacrifice for God's sin, as it were, on every New 
Moon.<br>
