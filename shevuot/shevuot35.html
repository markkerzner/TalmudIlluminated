<span style="font-size: medium;">There
 are five cases when there is no liability for the false oath of 
testimony: where one testifies to a promise, not actual giving of money;
 where he adjures them to testify when they will know the testimony in 
the future; where he addressed himself to a whole group of people, 
without specifying the witnesses; where their testimony would be hearsay
 or otherwise invalid; where he sent his slave to adjure the witnesses, 
or if it was the defendant, not the claimant, who adjured them.<br>
<br>
If one said, &#8220;I adjure you,&#8221; &#8220;I command you,&#8221; &#8220;I bind you&#8221; (to testify) &#8211; the witnesses are liable.<br>
<br>
If they swore by heaven and earth, then they are not liable. However, if
 they swore by &#8220;Lord,&#8221; by the Tetragrammaton, by the &#8220;Lord of Hosts,&#8221; 
&#8220;Compassionate,&#8221; &#8220;Merciful,&#8221; &#8220;Slow to Anger,&#8221; &#8220;Abundantly Kind,&#8221; or by 
any of the subordinate Names of God &#8211; they are liable.<br>
