<span style="font-size: medium;">There are two 
shades of white color on one's skin that signify that one is possibly 
sick with a spiritual leprosy called Tsara'at. Two are mentioned in the 
Torah as &#8220;white spot&#8221; and &#8220;raised white spot.&#8221; Two more are derived from
 the word &#8220;additional,&#8221; meaning auxiliary shades of white. They thus 
make &#8220;two that are four.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;White spot&#8221; is white as snow; &#8220;raised white spot&#8221; is darker and is like
 white wool. The shade auxiliary to snow-white is that of lime of the 
Temple; the shade auxiliary to white wool is the color of egg membrane. 
The minimal size of a white spot that is considered significant is that 
of a lentil bean. Two primary shades combine with each for the size of 
the bean; auxiliary shades combine with their primary ones. This is 
analogous to two kings and their governors.<br>
<br>
Yehoshuah the son of Rabbi Akiva asked, &#8220;Why not just teach that any 
shade that is whiter than the egg membrane is significant?&#8221; Rabbi Akiva 
answered him, &#8220;To test the Kohanim, who must be knowledgeable in the 
shades of Tsara'at, in order to judge.&#8221;<br>
