<span style="font-size: medium;">Since
 the punishment for violating a Biblical oath is very severe, Rashi 
writes that Jewish courts in his time refrained from asking the 
defendant to swear and instead placed a curse on any defendant who would
 lie.<br>
<br>
If the defendant says, &#8220;I will not swear,&#8221; he is immediately excused 
from court, owes money, and does not come back to change his opinion. 
However, if he says, &#8220;I shall swear,&#8221; those standing there recite the 
phrase &#8220;Turn away from the tents of these wicked men.&#8221; Even the 
plaintiff is considered guilty for causing an oath, since he should not 
have dealt with an untrustworthy person.<br>
<br>
The judges tell him, &#8220;You should know that the whole world trembled at 
the words 'Do not take the name of Hashem your God in vain'&#8221; And why is 
this? Because about a false oath it says, &#8220;God will not absolve.&#8221;<br>
