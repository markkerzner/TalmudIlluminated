<span style="font-size: medium;">If
 the plaintiff says, &#8220;You have a maneh ($5,000) of mine in your 
possession,&#8221; and the defendant responds, &#8220;You do not have anything of 
yours in my possession,&#8221; - the defendant is free from an oath, since 
there is no admission of partial liability.<br>
<br>
The Torah assumes that no person would be so impudent as to deny a loan 
outright. After all, the lender did him a favor by loaning money 
interest-free (and other types of loans are anyway forbidden). When the 
borrower partially admits a loan, but partially denies it, this is just 
because he does not have all the money and plans to pay the balance 
later on. This is not right, however, and the Torah imposes an oath on 
him. But we cannot assume this in the case of complete denial.<br>
<br>
Later, however, this situation has changed, and the Sages established an
 &#8220;Oath of Forgetfulness&#8221; even for cases of complete denial. However, 
this Rabbinical oath is different in that it can be switched: if the 
defendant does not want to take an oath, the plaintiff can take an oath 
and collect the money.<br>
