<span style="font-size: medium;">If one says, &#8220;An 
oath that I will eat&#8221; (a certain food object), or &#8220;An oath that I will 
not eat&#8221; - these are <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-4.htm">the two
 oaths explicit in the Torah</a>. &#8220;An oath that I ate,&#8221; or &#8220;An oath that
 I did not eat&#8221; - these are the two types of oath derived by exegesis.<br>
<br>
If one swore, &#8220;An oath that I will not eat,&#8221; and then, forgetting his 
oath, ate even a minute amount, he is liable &#8211; these are the words of 
Rabbi Akiva. The Sages said to Rabbi Akiva, &#8220;Where do we find regarding 
one who eats a minute amount of forbidden food that he is liable?&#8221; There
 has to be a minimum amount! Rabbi Akiva replied to them, &#8220;And where do 
we find that one speaks and brings an offering because of mere words?&#8221;<br>
