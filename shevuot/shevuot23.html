<span style="font-size: medium;">If
 one swore, &#8220;An oath that I will not eat!&#8221; - and then he ate wheat 
bread, barley bread and spelt bread &#8211; he is liable for only one 
offering. But if he swore, &#8220;An oath that I will not eat wheat bread, 
barley bread and spelt bread!&#8221; - and then he ate all three &#8211; he is 
liable for each one.<br>
<br>
But why? Maybe all he meant was &#8220;no breads,&#8221; and this is all one oath? -
 If so, he should have said, &#8220;I will not eat wheat, barley and spelt.&#8221; <br>
<br>
But maybe he meant to prohibit himself from chewing those grains? - If so, he should have said, &#8220;I will not eat <i>bread</i>
 of wheat, barley and spelt.&#8221; Instead, he included the word &#8220;bread&#8221; 
every time, thus separating his oath into three separate oaths.<br>
