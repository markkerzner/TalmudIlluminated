<span style="font-size: medium;">Oaths can be of 
two types: to do something, or not to do it. For example, &#8220;I will eat 
this bread&#8221; or &#8220;I will not eat this bread.&#8221; These are <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-4.htm">the oaths explicitly mentioned 
in the Torah</a>. However, one can derive the same two types of oaths as
 related to the past, where the person swears that he did something, or 
didn't do it. All four types, if made inadvertently, require the 
offender to bring a variable-type offering, which depends on his means.<br>
<br>
(Here the Talmud digresses from oaths to discuss other cases of &#8220;two 
that are in reality four.&#8221; It will not come back to oaths until after 
eighteen pages.)<br>
<br>
But why study oaths right after Makkot (lashes)? Because one of the last
 subjects in Makkot was multiple penalties for one transgression, and 
&#8220;two that are four&#8221; is formulated similarly.<br>
