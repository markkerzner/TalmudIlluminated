<span style="font-size: medium;">Here are three (of five) explanations why this is so.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Eliezer:<br>
<br>
In <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-1.htm">the verse about the oath of testimony</a>, the word &#8220;or&#8221; is stated two times, and in <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-2.htm">the verse about the oath of deposit</a>
 the word "or" is also stated two times. This establishes the connection
 between the two, and just as oath of deposits speaks only of a monetary
 claims, so too the oath of testimony speaks only of a monetary claim.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Akiva:<br>
<br>
In the phrase, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-5.htm">When one shall become guilty in regard to one of these matters</a>,&#8221;
 the word &#8220;of&#8221; is a limitation, meaning that there are cases when one is
 liable and cases when one is not, and when is he liable? - in money 
matters!<br>
<br>
Rabbi Yose HaGlili:<br>
<br>
&#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-1.htm">and he is a witness who either saw or knew</a>.&#8221; Which testimony can be established by either seeing or knowing alone? - in money matters!<br>
