On the other hand, communal offerings can be brought on Shabbat, and even in the state of impurity, but personal offerings cannot. <br/> <br/> Rav Dimi had a clarification for these rules, concerning libations. He said, "If I had someone to carry a letter go Babylon, I would write and send this clarification to them." But would he send it? The Torah said that " <a href = "null">Write these words</a> ..." Â refers to the written Torah scroll, but " <a href = "null">Through these words</a> " refers to all other laws that one is not permitted to write down! - A new law is different, for it is better to violate the Torah prohibition of writing than risk whole Torah being forgotten. <br/> <br/> But how can the Talmud even ask such a question, when we know that Rabbi Yehudah the Prince collected and published the Mishnah, and Rav Ashi collected and published the Talmud? - There are two versions Rav Sherirah Gaon's letter, and according to one, they only collected but did not publish. <br/> <br/> Art: Gabriel Metsu - Man Writing a Letter</body></html>
