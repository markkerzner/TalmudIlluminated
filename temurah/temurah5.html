The "you may not" is represented by Abaye, and "you can not" - by Rava. According to Abaye, if one violates a law, he is punished with lashes, because his act was effective. But according to Rava, why is he punished, if he achieved nothing? - Simply because he violated the statement of the Merciful One.
<br />
<br />
The Talmud presents fourteen challenges, some to Abaye and some to Rava. Below are a two of them.
<br />
<br />
One who violates a girl has to marry her and can never divorce her. If he does divorce her, he has to re-marry her (if she agrees), but he is not given lashes. Why not? According to Rava, he should receive lashes for just violating the commandment!? Rava answers that it is a special case: since he needs to re-marry her, in a sense he achieved nothing.
<br />
<br />
What about sacrifice exchange, where <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2012/02/temurah-2-sacrifice-exchange.html">we learned that</a>, although forbidden, the act takes effect? Rava will answer that it is an exception, since the Torah said "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3578">It and its exchange will be holy,</a>" but normally an illegal act achieves nothing.
