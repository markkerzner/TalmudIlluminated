Why is that? Because in the case of things that must be buried, their ash is also forbidden for benefit, but for things that must be burned - their ash is permitted. <br/> <br/> End of Tractate Temurah <br/> <br/> Art: David Fulton - A girl in an orchard with a basket of apples <br/> <br/></body></html>
