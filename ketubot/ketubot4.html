Why? - In those times, it was customary for the father of the groom to prepare the wedding feast, and for the mother of the bride to provide her with adornments. So there would be no one to assist them otherwise. <br/> <br/> In this situation, having consummated the marriage, the husband separates from his wife for the seven days of the wedding and for the following seven days of mourning and sleeps among men. This is because, after all, the groom is a mourner right after burial. A mourner is forbidden to be intimate with his wife. Thus, although externally he observes the seven days of celebration, in private he refrains from intimacy as a mourner. And even sleeping in separate quarters applies only if he was prevented from consummating the marriage - because then he may be overcome by desire and violate the rules - but if he has already been intimate with his wife once, he can be trusted to control himself. <br/> <br/> Art: A Wedding Feast by Pieter The Younger Brueghel</body></html>
