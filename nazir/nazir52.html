How much of a dead body? One of the example is a skull and spine - just bones, even if they have no meat on them. <br/> <br/> There were actually two versions of this rule, one read "skull and spine," but the other one - "skull or spine." According to the second one, either a skull or a spine are enough for nazir to loose his days and shave. Which one is right? <br/> <br/> The Talmud tries to resolve this in many ways. For example, since there are six questions related to nazir where Rabbi Akiva initially held a more stringent position but eventually conceded to the Sages, if his position was more stringent here too and read "skull or spine" - then the total count would be seven, not six. However, Rabbi Shimon says that there was another rule, about a "quarter-measurement of blood from two different dead" where Rabbi Akiva never conceded. This changes the count and ruins our proof. <br/> <br/> Incidentally, Rabbi Shimon emphasized his points as follows, "While Rabbi Akiva was alive, he never changed his mind on this question, and whether he retracted after death - I don't know about that." Unfortunately, this was not the most refined way of putting it. Rabbi Shimon felt remorse and fasted, to atone for it, until his teeth darkened. <br/> <br/> Art: An old man, holding a skull by Jan Lievens</body></html>
