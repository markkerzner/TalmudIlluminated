The first said, "I am a nazir if this is John." The second one said, "I am nazir if this is not John." The third one said to the first two - "I am a nazir if one of you is now a nazir." The fourth one said, "I am a nazir if one of you two is not nazir." The fifth one said, "I am a nazir if both of you are nazirim." And the sixth said - talking to all five - " I am a nazir that you are all nazirim." What is their status? <br/> <br/> 1) Beit Shammai say that they are all nazirim. All of them really wanted to become nazirim, and added their qualifications as a by-the-way, but not essential to their vow. <br/> <br/> 2) Beit Hillel said that only those whose conditions are fulfilled become nazirim. This is the most straightforward logic. <br/> <br/> 3) Rabbi Tarfon says that nobody is a nazir. A conditional vow does not make a nazir at all, it has to be clear and direct. <br/> <br/> If now the person in question suddenly turned back, and they never found out who he was, what is their status then? <br/> <br/> 4) Rabbi Yehudah says that no one becomes a nazir, because a person never accepts to be a nazir out of doubt. <br/> <br/> 5) Rabbi Shimon says that he has a real problem: he is a nazir out of doubt, but cannot get out of this, because only a real nazir is allowed to shave his had, so if he is not a nazir, he cannot complete his vow. Therefore, he should do declare: "If I am a real nazir - well and good, but if not, I am now become one out of my free will." <br/> <br/> Art: Still Life With Wine, Bottles And A Cigar by Christian Schmidt</body></html>
