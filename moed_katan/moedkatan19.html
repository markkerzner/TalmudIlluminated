For example, when one loans money to his friend for the needs of the Holiday, he should not require that the loan document is written. However, if he does not trust the borrower, or if the scribe is poor and needs the money - then writing is allowed. Likewise, a scribe should not write tefillin or a Sefer Torah. Rabbi Yehudah allows him to write tefillin for himself - and then change his mind and sell it. And Rabbi Yose says that the enjoyment of the Holiday is more important than refraining from work - therefore he can write tefilin and sell it, as usual, in order to add to his festivities. <br/> <br/> One whose relative dies has to observe the period of seven days of mourning after the burial - these are called "shivah," or "seven." However, if a Holiday comes during these days, his "shivah" is canceled by the joy of the holidays. <br/> <br/> After "shivah" there is a period of thirty days, or "shloshim." Likewise, if a Holiday occurs during this time - that is, after shivah and until thirty days after the burial have passed - his shloshim are canceled. <br/> <br/> On Shabbat one does not observe any external signs of mourning - that is, he wears shoes and nice clothing, eats meat and drinks wine - and the day is counted as part of his shivah. However, unlike a Holiday, Shabbat does not cancel the mourning, only suspends it. <br/> <br/> Art: The Scribe by Charles Wilda</body></html>
