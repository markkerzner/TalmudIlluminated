How do we know that? - When the wife of Ezekiel died, God told him " Put on <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefillin">tefillin</a>, which is your glory ." We understand from here that ordinarily a mourner is prohibited from wearing a <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefillin">tefillin</a>. <br/> <br/> Two classes of people who are similar to a mourner are those excommunicated by the court and those who are a metzora (spiritual leper). Can an excommunicated person wear <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefillin">tefillin</a>? - The Talmud does not know the answer. <br/> <br/> Can a metzora wear them? Since his head should be " <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=13#P3095">disheveled</a> ," Rabbi Eliezer understands this as simply "no haircut." However, Rabbi Akiva says that the same word, "<a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=13#P3095">disheveled</a>," is said about his garments, so here it must mean that his head is lacking a garment. Should we say that this means the removal of <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefillin">tefillin</a>? -- Not necessarily, perhaps it means the removal of a hat or a turban. Thus, in both cases we don't know the answer. <br/> <br/> Mourner is also not supposed to greet others, learn Torah, launder, do work and wear shoes. Do these laws apply to an excommunicated person and a metzora? The Talmud investigates each situation and finds answers in many cases; for example, in contrast to a mourner, the other two categories are allowed to study Torah and teach it to others. <br/> <br/> Art: A Jerusalemite Shepherd Winding the Phylacteries for the Hand by Carl Haag</body></html>
