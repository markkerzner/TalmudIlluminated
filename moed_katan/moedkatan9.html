Why would joy be a problem? - Precisely because the Festivals are already joyful occasions, and one should not mix one joy with another. Some say - because in order to make his wedding a joyful occasion he will exert himself too much. Yet others explain that if marriages were allowed on the Festivals, then people might postpone their weddings until the Festivals, in order to save on preparations, and would thus delay the commandment to be fruitful and multiply. <br/> <br/> If one has to mend or make his clothing for the sake of the Holiday, and he is not a professional tailor, he can sew in a regular way. However, if he is a professional, then he should take care to sew with irregular stitches. This distinction between unskilled worker and a professional applies to other works on the holiday weekdays. <br/> <br/> Art: Portrait of a Young Married Couple by Jacob Jordaens</body></html>
