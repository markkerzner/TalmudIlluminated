Some say that Esther was of unhealthy complexion, and only Divine intervention made her beloved by all; they take out Esther from the list, and put in Vashti.
<br />
<br />
Rachav inspired lust by the mere mention of her name. In fact, one who says "Rachav, Rachav" would emit a seminal discharge. Rav Nachman said to Rav Yitchak, "I said it, and I was not concerned." Rav Yitchak answered, "I meant, only those who knew her."
<br />
<br />
Rabbi Elazar retold the following teaching of Rabbi Chanina: Whoever transmits a teaching and mentions who he heard it from - brings redemption to the world, just as Esther, who "told the king about a plot against him - in the name of Mordechai."<br />
<br />
More teachings from Rabbi Chanina follow.
<br />
<br />
Haman said, "All my wealth is not worth anything to me when I see Mordechai." Why? - Because of an incident when Haman sold himself as a slave to Mordechai, and "all that belongs to the slave really belongs to his master."
<br />
<br />
Another teaching: in the future God himself will be the crown of beauty on the head of every righteous. The Attribute of Justice then said, "How are these (Israel) different from the others?" God replied, "They study the Torah, and the others do not." Then the Attribute of Justice said, "But the wrongdoers among them will still have to give an account," and to this the Talmud does not give here any answer.
