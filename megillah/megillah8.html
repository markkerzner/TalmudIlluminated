For other laws - such as reading the four special Torah portions reminding of important events - they are equal. From here on, we have a series of "there is no difference" statements. <br/> <br/> There is no difference between the laws of Shabbat and Holidays, except that on Holidays one is allowed to cook for people's consumption. <br/> <br/> There is no difference between Shabbat and Yom Kippur, except that for doing work on Shabbat one may get punished by the Sanhedrin, and for the same on Yom Kippur - there is only "being cut off from one's people." <br/> <br/> There is no difference between a vow prohibiting one all benefit from the other person and a vow prohibiting food benefits - because many things lead to food - except for the permission to pass through his property. <br/> <br/> There is no difference between vowing to bring a sacrifice and designating a specific animal, except that when he vows and then buys an animal, and it is lost or dies, he has to buy another one. <br/> <br/> There is no difference between a zav (see here ) who had two emissions and one who had three, but that the latter needs to bring a sacrifice. <br/> <br/> A metzora (spiritual leper) may be quarantined and then declared a definite metzora. There is no difference between the two states, except that the latter also needs to let his hair grow and to tear his garments as a sign of grief. <br/> <br/> Art: An old lady cooking apples by Johannes Weiland</body></html>
