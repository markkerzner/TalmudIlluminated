However, sometimes for convenience the Megillah can read on the eleventh, twelfth or thirteenth. <br/> <br/> What is the source for making those "convenience" dates? - But first, what is the meaning of this question? Purim occurred long after the giving of the Torah, what source can there be in the writings for it? - Here is what we mean: it was the Sages that established the fourteenth and the fifteenth as the day of celebration, based on the text of the Megillah itself. These same Sages must have added the provisions of the earlier days. What was their source? <br/> <br/> It is here: " <a href = "null">To establish these days of Purim in their times</a> ," and the words "their times" indicate multiple days. "Their" gives two days, and "times" gives another two days. But we need five days total! That is because the thirteenth is when everybody came together to defend themselves, and it does not need a special word in order to be added to the times of reading the Megillah. The Talmud quotes another phrase as the source and explains why these two opposing points of view do not agree with each other. <br/> <br/> These dispensation only existed when the years were properly fixed by the Court and the Jews lived in Israel, but later, when people were calculating Passover dates as thirty days from Purim, the Megillah began to be read only on the fourteenth of Adar, and for cities that were walled in the times of Yehoshua (such as Jerusalem) - on the fifteenth. <br/> <br/> Art: Two Jews Quarrelling by Alexander Orlovsky</body></html>
