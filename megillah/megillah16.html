Haman, thinking of himself, said, "That man should be made to ride on king's horse, in king's garments." The king said "Do this for Mordechai."
<br />
<br />
Haman tried to argue, "Why do you need to do all of this? If you want to thank Mordechai, just give him a village or a river, to collect taxes." Ahashverosh answered, "This, too, do for him." That is why the Megillah states, "Do not leave out any word of what you have said."
<br />
<br />
Haman went to Mordechai, to put him on king's horse. However, Mordechai said that he was weak from the fast, and could not mount the horse by himself. Haman had to bow down and allow Mordechai to step on him. As he was mounting the horse, Mordechai also kicked Haman. Haman asked him, "How can you do this? Your own king Solomon tells you, 'When your enemy falls, do not rejoice.'?" Mordechai answered, "That is said about a Jewish enemy. But about you it says, 'You shall tread upon their high places.'"
<br />
<br />
The Talmud then turns to the story of Benjamin, from whom Mordechai descended. When Joseph received his brothers in Egypt, he gave to Benjamin five portions of food and five garments, thus showing preferential treatment. How could he do this, seeing that Jacob's preferential treatment of him earlier led to brothers hating and selling him? The answer is that Joseph was thus influencing the future for Mordechai, who would wear five royal garments.
