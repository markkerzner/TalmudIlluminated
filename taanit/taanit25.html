His wife was embarrassed of their poverty and would put smoking wood into her empty oven on Friday. Her neighbor once decided to check what was she baking - since she knew that they had nothing - and knocked on the door. R. Chanina’s wife hid inside. However, the neighbor saw an oven full of bread and called - "Your bread is being burned, bring a shovel!" R’ Chanina’s wife replied that she went for the shovel herself. This was actually true, since she was used to miracles. <br/> <br/> Another time, however, she said it was too hard and asked Rabbi Chanina to pray. A golden hand appeared and gave him one leg of a golden table. However, Rabbi Chanina was shown a dream where in the World to Come all were eating at a three-legged table, but the table of his wife and him only had two. She asked him to pray again, and the leg was taken back. <br/> <br/> Once R’ Chanina’s daughter was sad: she put vinegar instead of oil into the Shabbat lamp. However, R’ Chanina commented: the One who made the oil burn can command the vinegar to burn, and so it was: vinegar lamp burned till the end of Shabbat . <br/> <br/> Rabbi Chanina had some goats, and the neighbors claimed that they were ruining their fields. Rabbi Chanina said, "If they do - they should be eaten by bears, but if not - each should bring a bear on her horns," and indeed, each goat brought a bear on its horns. <br/> <br/> Art: Dancing Bears by William Holbrook Beard</body></html>
