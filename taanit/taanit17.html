Since the Temple can be rebuilt any day, it follows that a Kohen who knows the day when he would be serving in the Temple should not drink wine on that day. If he does not know that day but knows the week - he should not drink wine this week. And since Kohanim today do not know their lineage and Temple schedule, they should not drink wine ever.
<br />
<br />
However, Rabbi Yehudah the Prince says that although it is true, but what can he say - since their ruin (not being able to serve in the Temple) is also their help: it has many years that the Temple has not been rebuilt, and they can now drink wine any time. 
<br />
<br />
But, by the same token, they should also cut their hair at least every thirty days! Why? - Because drinking wine and growing long hair are prohibited in the same phrase. - No, that logic is wrong! If the Temple is rebuilt and we are looking for a Kohen to serve there, and cannot find him - we are in trouble. But a long-haired Kohen can quickly take a haircut and go serve.
