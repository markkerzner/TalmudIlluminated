Among the Kohanim, it goes to the family that serves in the Temple this week.
<br />
<br />
If one pronounced a dedication but did not specify who it should go to, then it goes to the upkeep of the Temple - so says Rabbi Yehoshua ben Beteira, since the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3596">Any dedication ("cherem") is most holy to God</a>."  However, the Sages says that any unspecified dedication goes to the Kohanim, since the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=27#P3579">Any dedicated field shall be to the Kohen</a>." If so, how do the Sages explain the phrase used by Rabbi Yehoshua? - It teaches that one can dedicate ("cherem") even offerings that are already holy , which will result in additional obligations on his part.
<br />
<br />
If one sells an ancestral field, he is not permitted to redeem it less than two years after the sale, as the Torah said, "<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=3&amp;CHAPTER=25#P3482">According to the number of crops is the price</a>", and the minimal number of plural "crops" is two. However, a year of drought or a shemittah year  don't go into the count.
