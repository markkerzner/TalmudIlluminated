  One can make a personal valuation vow to the Temple, promising to donate his own or someone elseâ€™s value.
  Furthermore, one can promise either a monetary value - the price that this person could fetch in a slave market
  - or a symbolic value, expressed in shekel coins, in the <a href="null">amount prescribed by the Torah</a> . <br /> <br />
  All persons can both declare such a vow and be the subject of it,
  a man or a woman, Kohen, Levi, or a regular Jew.
  An androgyne or a person of undetermined gender can do all of the above, except for a symbolic value.
  Since Torah-assigned values are provided
  only for definite males or females, these two do not have a specific symbolic values that can be donate for them. Thus, if one makes a "personal valuation" vow related to them, it is always treated as a monetary value they would fetch in a slave
  market.
  <br /> <br />
  A deaf, deranged, or a minor can have their value donated by others, but they themselves cannot make such vows. Since they lack sufficient understanding, they are considered legally incompetent. <br /> <br />
