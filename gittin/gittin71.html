one became mute and they asked him, &#8220;Shall we write a get for your
wife?&#8221; and he nodded his head, they test him six times with questions

deaf-mute is presumed to lack clear understanding and can not contract
a biblically binding marriage. Rabbinical enactments validated his
marriage and divorce. Therefore, if his brother marries a woman and
dies, and the wife falls to him in a levirate marriage, he lacks the
legal power to divorce.
