Same for selling the slave to outside of Israel, because of the precept against leaving Israel. <br/> <br/> If one fertilizes his field in the seventh year, then as a penalty he can not sow it next year; however, if he dies, his sons can sow that field. <br/> <br/> If an Israeli woman marries outside of Israel and brings slaves as her do wry, is this a sale and do the slaves go free? The question remains unresolved.</body></html>
