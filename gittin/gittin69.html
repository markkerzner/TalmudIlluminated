remedies are recorded in the Talmud. One can not use them nowadays
because we are not certain of the exact meaning of the words, and
because the nature of people and medicines has changed. Here is one
such remedy.<br><br>For cataracts &#8211; bring a scorpion that is spotted
with seven colors because of its age, dry it out in the shade, grind it
and make a powder consisting of two parts antimony and one part ground
scorpion. Apply three doses to one eye and three doses to another. One
must beware not to apply more, or the eyes may burst.
