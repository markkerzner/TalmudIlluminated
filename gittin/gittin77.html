someone throws a Get to his wife while she is inside her house or
inside her courtyard, she is divorced, because her property has
acquired the Get for her. If he threw the Get while she was inside his
house, even if the Get is with her in the same bed, - she is not
divorced, because the Get has not been placed in her domain.<br><br>If he threw the Get into her lap or into her sewing basket hanging from her, she is divorced.<br><br>Later authorities prohibited divorcing a wife without her consent.
