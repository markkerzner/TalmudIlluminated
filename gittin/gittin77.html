If he threw the Get while she was inside his house, even if the Get is with her in the same bed, - she is not divorced, because the Get has not been placed in her domain. <br/> <br/> If he threw the Get into her lap or into her sewing basket hanging from her, she is divorced. <br/> <br/> Later authorities prohibited divorcing a wife without her consent.</body></html>
