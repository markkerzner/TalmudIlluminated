man said to his sharecropper, "Sharecroppers usually water the field
three times a year and take one-forth of the produce as payment for
their work. However, you water four times a year and take one-third of
the crop." The sharecropper accepted the proposal. Eventually rain came
and made it unnecessary to water the crops for the fourth time.<br><br>One
side: since the sharecropper did not actually irrigate a fourth time,
only one-quarter of the produce is due him. Another: since it was not
necessary to irrigate the fourth time, the sharecropper takes
one-third. The second point of view is preferred.</div></body></html>
