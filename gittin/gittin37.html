Rich, because they do not transgress "do not refrain from helping with a loan", and poor, because it helps them obtain a loan. <br/> <br/> Prosbul works by assigning the loan to court for collection. It is then "as if collected", and such loan is not canceled by the 7th year. <br/> <br/> Only unsecured loans are canceled and thus require prosbul. <br/> <br/> Even if a debt is canceled by the 7th year, it is meritorious to return the money as a gift. <br/> <br/></body></html>
