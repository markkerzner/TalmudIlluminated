However, he can not sue for the crop which was on the land - because this obligation was not fixed and thus was not guaranteed by the seller (thief). <br/> <br/> <br/> If someone is returning a lost object and the owner claims that not everything is returned, then it is decreed that the finder does not have to take an oath to his truthfulness - so that the people should not refrain from returning found objects.</body></html>
