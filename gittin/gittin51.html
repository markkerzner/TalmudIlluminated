someone buys land which is later found to be stolen and the original
owner repossesses it, the deceived buyer can sue the seller (thief) for
the amount. However, he can not sue for the crop which was on the land
- because this obligation was not fixed and thus was not guaranteed by
the seller (thief).<br><br><br>If someone is returning a lost object
and the owner claims that not everything is returned, then it is
decreed that the finder does not have to take an oath to his
truthfulness - so that the people should not refrain from returning
found objects.</div></body></html>
