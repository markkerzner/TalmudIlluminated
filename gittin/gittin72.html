In all three cases, the Get is void because the husband stipulated that it will take effect after his death and this is impossible. <br/> <br/> If he said, "This is your Get from today if I die from this illness," - it is a valid Get. It takes effect retroactively, but care must be taken not to invalidate the Get by living together.</body></html>
