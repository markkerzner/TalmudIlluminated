a husband told his wife, &#8220;This is your Get if I die,&#8221; or, &#8220;This is your
Get if I die from this illness,&#8221; or &#8220;This is your Get after my death,&#8221;
he has not said anything. In all three cases, the Get is void because
the husband stipulated that it will take effect after his death and
this is impossible.<br><br>If he said, &#8220;This is your Get from today if
I die from this illness,&#8221; - it is a valid Get. It takes effect
retroactively, but care must be taken not to invalidate the Get by
living together.</div></body></html>
