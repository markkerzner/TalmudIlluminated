woman can loan to her friend a sieve or a hand-mill, even if her friend
uses forbidden produce of the seventh year, because her friend may use
the implements for permitted produce - but she should not cook with her.<br><br>One
can deposit his tithed produce with a friend who is not careful about
tithes, and should not suspect that the friend will substitute it. But
what about the rule that one should tithe flour when he gives it to his
mother-in-law and also after she bakes it into bread? His mother-in-law
would substitute burned bread, to help her daughter.
