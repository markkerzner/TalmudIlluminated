Money and readily-sold personalty, if available, are first choice. <br/> <br/> Creditors collect their payments from the medium quality land - so that people would not refrain from making loans. However, since money was loaned, if the borrower has money, he pays that. <br/> <br/> Ketubah payments are collected from the inferior land, in order to prevent women who unscrupulously marry in order to provoke divorce and collect their ketubah dowers. <br/> <br/> These measures are for the benefit of society. <br/> <br/> Art: Le prÃªteur et sa femme (The money lender and his wife) by Quentin METSYS</body></html>
