Eliezer validated a Get with a condition "You are permitted to marry
any man but so-and-so." Rabbi Eliezer&#8217;s learning was supreme, but after
his death many Rabbis got together to disprove this teaching of his.
However, all but one of their rebuttals had potential flaws.<br><br>The
undisputable proof came from Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria. He deduced the
requirement of complete severance from the term that the Torah used,
"Kritut," as opposed to a possible shorter word "Karet." This,
according to Rabbi Elazar Ben Azaria, teaches that temporary conditions
in the Get are valid, but permanent are not.
