one gives his wife a Get and says, &#8220;You are hereby permitted to any man
except to my father or your father,&#8221; or &#8220;to a slave or an idolater,&#8221;
the divorce is valid, since her marriage to any of these man would not
be binding.<br><br>But what if the husband makes a condition that she
can not marry a particular minor? Now the minor can not marry, but
eventually he will become adult. By comparison with a minor girl who
can divorce because eventually she will marry as adult, the Get above
is declared not complete separation, thus void.</body></html>
