Why? Should he later find that his information was false, he may be tempted to regret, attempt to invalidate the Get and thus create complications. <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/> If a husband divorces his wife because she is sterile, he can not remarry her, for the same reason. If she later marries another man, has children, and wants her ketubah payment from her first husband, he can tell her: "Your silence is better than your speech", because he can invalidate her divorce.</body></html>
