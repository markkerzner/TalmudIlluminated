husband who divorces his wife because of her bad reputation can not
later remarry her, provided he told her the reason. Why? Should he
later find that his information was false, he may be tempted to regret,
attempt to invalidate the Get and thus create complications.<br><br><br><br><br><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SLS-xEtQk_I/AAAAAAAAAKs/NB5o24NpGWg/s1600-h/gittin46-2.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SLS-xEtQk_I/AAAAAAAAAKs/NB5o24NpGWg/s320/gittin46-2.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5239022016825168882" border="0"></a><br><br><br><br><br>If
a husband divorces his wife because she is sterile, he can not remarry
her, for the same reason. If she later marries another man, has
children, and wants her ketubah payment from her first husband, he can
tell her: &#8220;Your silence is better than your speech&#8221;, because he can
invalidate her divorce.
