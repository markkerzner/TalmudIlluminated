If you get angry after a meal, you will be filled to capacity but not become ill. <br/> <br/> One who is impotent should bring 3 vessels of 3 reviit (~3 ounce) of saffron that grew in a field fertilized with sheep manure, grind them up, boil them in wine and drink. Rabbi Yochanan said, "It is exactly this which made me like a teenager again." <br/> <br/> Three things drain a person's strength: anxiety, travel, and regret of sin. <br/> <br/> <br/></body></html>
