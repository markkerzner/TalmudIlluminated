Shammai say, &#8220;A man may not divorce his wife unless he found in her an
act of adultery.&#8221; Proof: &#8220;Because he found in her an adulterous matter.&#8221;<br><br>But Beit Hillel say, &#8220;Even if she burned his dish.&#8221; Proof: &#8220;Adulterous or any other matter.&#8221;<br><br>Rabbi
Akiva says, &#8220;Even if he found another more attractive than her.&#8221; Proof:
&#8220;And it comes to pass that she does not find favor in his eyes.&#8221;<br><br>Despised by God is anyone who sends away his wife without a compelling reason.<br><br>Whenever anyone divorces his first wife, even the Temple Alter sheds tears on his account.
