                            If two men sent two identical Gittin to their wives through an agent (the names of the husbands and their wives being identical), and the Gittin were confused by the agent, he must give both Gittin to both women.

If five men wrote a common text in the Get, namely, "I, so-and-so, am divorcing my wife, so-and-so, etc.," the Get is valid for all five couples, and it should be given to every one of the women named in it to effect her divorce.
