sage should not help an unlearned person to separate the priest's
portion from dough. The unlearned person's dough is presumed to be
ritually impure, but the priest might think it pure, since it comes

allowed to kneed dough for the unlearned, then separate the priest's
portion - but teach the unlearned not to touch the dough.</p>  <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Man
can appoint an agent to take a Get to his wife, but can retract while
the Get is on the way. If he appoints the agent for receiving the Get,
she is divorced immediately.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SMngoC-5QRI/AAAAAAAAARM/HBhzmAqmraE/s1600-h/gittin62.jpg"><img style="margin: 0pt 0pt 10px 10px; float: right; cursor: pointer;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/SMngoC-5QRI/AAAAAAAAARM/HBhzmAqmraE/s320/gittin62.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5244970219649712402" border="0"></a></p></div></body></html>
