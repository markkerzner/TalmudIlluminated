can appoint another man as an agent to deliver a Get to his wife, and
wife can appoint another woman as an agent to accept a Get &#8211; because
they appoint others like them to do what they are empowered to do.<br><br>Moreover,
husband can appoint a woman for the delivery of a Get, and wife can
appoint a man for the receipt. Since they can be a party to divorce,
they can also act as agents in any capacity.</div></body></html>
