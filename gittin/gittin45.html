If
a man gives his sister a ring in marriage (which all know to be
invalid), Rav says, he gave it for safekeeping to be returned, but
Shmuel says, he gave it as a present to keep.<br>
<br>
If a slave runs away to Israel, he is not returned to his master.<br>
<br>
One
should not ransom captives (with some exceptions) for much more than
their worth. Is it not to burden the community, or not to accustom the
captors to gain? - Unresolved.<br>
<br>
One should not ransom tefillin or Torah for more than their worth nor
should one provoke with low offer.
