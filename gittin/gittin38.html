Since he was a slave of a Jew, he now becomes a full-fledged Jew and can marry a Jewish woman. <br/> <br/> If the redeemer wants to keep him as a slave, he can, and the captor, who owns the work of his hands, can transmit the ownership further. <br/> <br/> Slaves should not be redeemed, except for a good cause. <br/> <br/> Art: The Idle Servant by Nicolaes Maes</body></html>
