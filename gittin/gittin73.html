Get of a seriously ill person has the same law as his gift, that is, if
he recovers, it is assumed that he changed his mind. The possession of
the gift returns to him, and the Get should be void. However, the Get
is decreed to take effect, to avoid the people thinking that the Get
can work after the husband&#8217;s death. Such mistake could lead to serious
consequences.<br><br>After receiving a conditional Get, the wife should
not be alone with her husband, unless it is in the presence of
witnesses &#8211; even witnesses not normally qualifying to give testimony.</div></body></html>
