Kamtza was invited to a feast by mistake and thrown out. He incited the
Roman ruler to destroy Jerusalem. The dispatched general divined by
bird flight and by arrows that Jerusalem will fall. He asked a child
what he was learning, and the child said, &#8220;I will take revenge on
Edom.&#8221; The general understood that God wants to destroy Jerusalem but
will then revenge on him, so he ran away, converted, and Rabbi Meir was
his descendant.<br><br>In those times, if one bought a plot in Israel from an oppressor, he had to also pay ¼ to the owner.
