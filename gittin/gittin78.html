a man handed a Get to his wife and said, &#8220;Please receive this note of
indebtedness,&#8221; or she found a document next to him, read it, and it was
a Get &#8211; it is not a valid Get, until he says to her, &#8220;Here is your Get.&#8221;<br><br>If he placed it in her hand while she was sleeping, and she awakes and it is her  Get, - it is not a valid Get.<br><br>If
she was standing in the street and he threw the Get to her, if it
landed close to her, she is divorced, otherwise, she is not divorced.
