                            If a man handed a Get to his wife and said, "Please receive this note of indebtedness," or she found a document next to him, read it, and it was a Get - it is not a valid Get, until he says to her, "Here is your Get."
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            
If he placed it in her hand while she was sleeping, and she awakes and it is her  Get, - it is not a valid Get.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            
If she was standing in the street and he threw the Get to her, if it landed close to her, she is divorced, otherwise, she is not divorced.
