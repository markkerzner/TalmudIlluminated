His words are not to nullify the Get but to avoid the embarrassment of the divorce. <br/> <br/> If one steals a beam, builds it into his mansion, and is challenged in court, he has to pay the cost of the beam but does not have to return the beam itself. This decree is to make it easy for the people who repent and want to return the stolen goods. <br/> <br/> <br/></body></html>
