one divorces his wife and says to her, &#8220;You are hereby permitted to any
man but so-and-so&#8221;, she is not divorced. What should he do? He should
take the Get from her and give it to her again, and say to her, &#8220;You
are hereby permitted to any man.&#8221;<br><br>But if he wrote this
restriction into the Get itself, although he later erased it, the Get
is invalid, since it never was a &#8220;document of severance.&#8221;
