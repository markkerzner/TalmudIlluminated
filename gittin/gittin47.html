All he left as inheritance was a quart of safflower oil, but he was still upset, quoting "they left their possessions to others." <br/> <br/> When an idolater buys land in Israel, does this remove mitzvot such as tithes? No, because of "since the (holiness of the) land is Mine." Yes, because "and the land He gave to the men". <br/> <br/> <br/> Art: The Money Lender by Dutch School</body></html>
