in the field of his fellow, he has not acquired any land &#8211; he has
merely purchased the rights to their produce. Thus, if a tree dies, the
buyer takes the dead wood, but he may not plant a tree on that site.
Rabbi Meir, however, says that he has acquired land.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
Therefore, if the branches of the trees grew until they extended over
the seller's land, the seller may not trim them, even if they block the
sunlight and thus damage his crops. Since the buyer gets no land, it is
understood that the seller pledges his own land to provide for the
needs of the tree.<br>
<br>
If someone purchased three trees, he has acquired land, since he surely
intended to buy a field of trees. Therefore, if the branches grew over
the seller's land, the seller may trim them.</span></body></html>
