measures clean once in thirty days, and a householder, once in twelve
months. This law applies to measures that are used for liquids which
leave a residue, such as wine or oil. Since the residue tends to settle
in the measure and congeal, the measure must be cleaned periodically.
Since a wholesaler sells frequently, his measure tends to gather
residue more quickly.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says that the opposite is true. Since the
wholesaler uses the measure more frequently, the residue that gathers
in it does not congeal between uses. Therefore, the wholesaler must
wipe his measures once in twelve months, and a householder &#8211; once in
thirty days.<br>

The phrase &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/25-15.htm">A perfect and just weight you shall have</a>...&#8221; teaches also that the seller must act justly and give the buyer a little extra.</span></body></html>
