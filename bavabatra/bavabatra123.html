</div><span style="font-size: medium;">Is the double portion of the firstborn simply double that of every other brother, or does he take 2/3 of the whole estate, with the other brothers dividing the remaining 1/3? <br />
<br />
The answer comes from the phrase "...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-16.htm">and it shall be on the day that he bequeaths to his sons</a>..." This phrase is superfluous, since the law it states - that the firstborn gets a double portion - is expressed in different words in the very next verse. Therefore, the superfluous phrase teaches that the other brothers - if there are more than one - get at least as much as the firstborn, that is, at least 1/2, which is more than 1/3. Now that the 2/3 possibility is out, the only remaining logical alternative is that the firstborn gets double the portion of each brother.<br />
