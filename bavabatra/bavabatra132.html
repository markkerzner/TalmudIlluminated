he is giving all his possessions to his wife, he has only made her an
administrator over his estate; she does not actually acquire it.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
The Sages determined that a man would not strip his sons of their
entire inheritance; therefore, it is assumed that he is merely
appointing her as an administrator, because he wants them to treat her
more respectfully. The administration lasts only while the children are
minors. The ruling applies only if he left over all his property to his
wife, but if he left anything to his sons, the gift to his wife was
genuine.<br>
