lend on interest, who reduce the size of their measures, and who
distort the markets, concerning them it says, &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/amos/8-4.htm">you who swallow up the needy and cause the poor of the land to fail...God has sworn... I will never forget any of their deeds</a>.&#8221; <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

Hoarders are market manipulators who engineer price increases in food
staples by hoarding large stores of food, then selling at these higher
prices. <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-25.htm">Lending on money on interest by one Jew to another is prohibited</a>.&nbsp;
Reducing the size of the measure means cheating the buyer. Market
manipulators are those who cause staple food prices to rise
artificially. The prohibition does not apply to specialty food items,
such as spices.</span></body></html>
