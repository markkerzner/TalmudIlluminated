<br>
Neither. While learning, the Sage may not have considered all aspects
of the matter. A practical ruling, on the other hand, may be
misunderstood by the observer as to the reason behind it. Rather, the
Sage has to declare both that the law agrees with a certain view, and
that it is to be followed in practice.<br>

Is the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-130-power-to-change.html">ruling about changes in inheritance</a> true for someone on his deathbed, because of &#8220;... <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-16.htm">on the day when he makes his sons inherit</a>...&#8221;,
or even for a one who is young and healthy? Rebbi said (and some state,
ruled in an actual case) that it works for a healthy person also. The
two reports disagree on &#8220;is theory or practice more important.&#8221;<br>
