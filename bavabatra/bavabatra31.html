ownership of a property. One said, &#8220;It was the land of my forefathers,&#8221;
and produced witnesses to that effect. The other one produced witnesses
that he used the land for three years, needed to establish chazakah.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
Rabbah said, &#8220;Why should he lie?&#8221; The current occupant could have kept
the land claiming that he bought it, so we should believe him when he
says that he inherited it. But Abaye said that &#8220;Why should he lie?&#8221;
can't be used to contradict witnesses.<br>
<br>
The current occupant then changed his claim, saying &#8220;Yes, the land
indeed belonged to your forefathers, but I bought it from them, and I
feel as secure as if it were my forefathers'&#8221; and this claim was
accepted.<br>
<br>
The general rule is: one cannot enter a claim that completely
contradicts his previous claim, but he can add information or amend the
previous claim by reinterpreting it.</span></body></html>
