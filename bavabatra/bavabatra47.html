testifying in a matter in which he has a material interest. Can a
sharecropper testify on behalf of his employer concerning the land on
which he is working?<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If there is unharvested fruit in the field, he cannot testify. The
sharecropper has a material interest, because if someone else should
prove to be the real owner of the field, the sharecropper will not
collect his full share of the unharvested fruit.<br>
<br>
However, if there is no fruit in the field, he can testify. Though
advancing his employer's cause might protect his own job as a
sharecropper in this field, he knows that there are many other
sharecropping jobs available to him. Moreover, he knows that his
employer is under no obligation to continue to employ him. Therefore,
his interest in the outcome of the case is negligible.</span></body></html>
