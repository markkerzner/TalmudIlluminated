<br>
What is the rule if one records making his deposit in a document, and
the custodian tells him, &#8220;I have already returned it to you&#8221;? Do we say
that if the custodian wished to lie, he could have said that the
deposit suffered an unavoidable mishap, in which case he would have
been believed? Therefore, we believe him on the strength of &#8220;why would
he lie?&#8221; argument?<br>
<br>
Or can the depositor ask, &#8220;Then why do I have this document in my hands?&#8221; - so &#8220;why would he lie?&#8221; is not applicable?<br>
<br>
Perhaps, the custodian didn't bother retrieving the document, because
he knew that he could claim unavoidable mishap and would be believed.
Therefore, he is believed now.</span></body></html>
