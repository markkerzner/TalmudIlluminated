the law follows Rabbi Nachman who said that the seller sells
generously. Rav Nachman was close to the Exilarch, the Jewish ruler of
Babylonia, and observed many judges and court cases, so he knew which
view was followed in practice.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
One who sold a house without specifying what was included in the sale
has sold the attached mortar, but not the movable mortar, and not the
movable oven or stove.&nbsp; If the seller said, &#8220;I am selling the house and
all that is contained therein,&#8221; - all of the movable objects are sold &#8211;
but not the objects that are easily movable (carried away). If one
sells a courtyard with everything therein, even easily movable objects
are sold. If one sells a town, even his animals therein are included.</span></body></html>
