distress until he finally relented and sold to them what they demanded,
his sale is a valid sale, and he cannot retract.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
What is the reason?<br>
<br>
* Is it because any sale is forced, since the seller needs money? - No, it could be different when it is against his will.<br>
* Is it because a recalcitrant husband who is forced to give a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_%28divorce_document%29">Get</a> is indeed divorced? - This is not a valid proof, because it is a mitzvah to heed the directive of the Sages.<br>
<br>
Rather, it is derived from the following ruling: if they subjected a </span><span style="font-size: medium;">woman</span><span style="font-size: medium;">
to distress until she agreed to be married, the marriage is valid. This
proof stands. However, the Sages later annulled such a marriage: he
behaved improperly, therefore, they behaved improperly with him.</span></body></html>
