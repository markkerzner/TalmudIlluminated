</div><span style="font-size: medium;">If a seriously ill person drafted a sickbed will in which he distributed all his property, it takes effect after his death, and no further action is needed. What happens if he also performed a symbolic acquisition and wrote about it in his will?<br />
<br />
Rav says that he is "riding on two steeds," giving his will both the power of a sickbed bequest and of the gift of a healthy person. Shmuel, however, says that he may have intended the acquisition to take effect after his death, and gifts cannot be given after death.<br />
<br />
Here are the rules then:</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"><br />
* A formal acquisition done without explanation invalidates the will;<br />
* A formal acquisition, explained to reinforce the bequest makes the recipient feel good, but is retractable upon the ill person's recovery;<br />
* A written will, delivered to the recipient, together with a formal acquisition, makes it irrevocable.<br />
