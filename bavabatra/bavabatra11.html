In addition, there must be four amot in front of each one's door, for unloading animals.<br /><br />The general rule is: anything that after division retains its name (such as a cloak if after division it becomes two small cloaks, and not two pieces of a garment) may be forcibly divided. However, partners may not divide scrolls of the Holy Scripture, even if both agree to it, since cutting them in court would be a disgraceful act.</span>
