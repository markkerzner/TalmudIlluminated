&#8220;house&#8221; in a large apartment building, even though he defined the
boundaries of the entire building in the deed, it is possible that he
intended to sell just one apartment, and he drew the boundaries of the
entire building only so that he could utilize known landmarks.&nbsp; Since
the seller stated that he was selling a &#8220;house&#8221; (as opposed to an
&#8220;apartment building&#8221;), the boundaries written in a deed are regarded as
imprecise, and the buyer acquires only one apartment.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
Therefore, it is recommended that the seller write some clause such as
&#8220;I am not retaining anything for myself in this transaction,&#8221; because
with it the seller relinquishes his possible claim that the boundaries
he drew were imprecise.</span></body></html>
