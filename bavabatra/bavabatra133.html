others and leaves his children without a legacy, what he has done is
done, that is, his gift is valid, but the spirit of the Sages is not
pleased with him. By disinheriting his children, he usurps the order of
succession ordained by the Torah.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: &#8220;If his children were not conducting
themselves properly, he is remembered for good.&#8221; Does Rabban Shimon ben
Gamliel explain the ruling or argue against it? <br>
<br>
The sons of one man did not conduct themselves property, and he left
all his possessions to Yonathan ben Uziel, who in turn sold a third,
donated another third to the Temple, and returned the rest to the sons
of the donor. Shammai came after him with his stick, but Yonathan
proved to Shammai that he did right.<br>
