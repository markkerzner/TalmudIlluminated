a courtyard resident has set up a store in the courtyard, one of the
other residents can block him by claiming, &#8220;I cannot sleep due to the
noise of your customers who go in and out of the courtyard.&#8221; <br>
<br>
But a courtyard resident may manufacture utensils in his home and go
out and sell them in the marketplace, and one cannot block him by
claiming, &#8220;I cannot sleep due to the noise of the hammer,&#8221; or &#8220;I cannot
sleep due to the noise of the children.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Why can </span><span style="font-size: medium;">the children </span><span style="font-size: medium;">go
in and out, while the customers can't? These are school children coming
to learn Torah. This ruling was taught after Yehoshua ben Gamla, a high
priest, mandated the installation of teachers in every town, and he is
remembered for good for preserving Torah study.</span></body></html>
