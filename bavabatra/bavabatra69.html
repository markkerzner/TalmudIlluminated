specifying what is included in the sale has sold the stones that are
for the use of the field, such as to hold the harvested sheaves. He has
also sold the reeds in the vineyard inside that field, used to support
the vines. He has sold produce that is attached to the ground, even if
it is ready to be cut. He has sold the carob tree that has not been
grafted and the virgin sycamore (planetree) that has not been pruned.
All these items either serve the field or aren't significant in their
own right.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If he said &#8220;I am selling you the field and all that is contained
therein,&#8221; he has additionally sold cut harvest.&nbsp; Even so, he has not
sold independent items, such as pruned sycamore tree and a sturdy
watchman's hut.</span></body></html>
