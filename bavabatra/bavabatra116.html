Yochanan said in the name of
Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai, &#8220;Whoever does not leave behind a son to
inherit him, the Holy One, Blessed be He is full of anger toward him.&#8221; <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
From where do we know this? &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-8.htm">if a man dies and he has no son, and you will pass (vehaavartem) his inheritance</a>...&#8221;  and &#8220;evrah&#8221; means a day of anger, as in &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/zephaniah/1-15.htm">a day of anger</a>...&#8221; <br>
<br>
But is it a son or a student? Since Rabbi Yochanan lost his ten sons
and would console people with &#8220;...look, this is a bone of my last
son...&#8221; - it must be that he meant a student, for otherwise he would
not publicize that God is angry with him. Then why did he say &#8220;son?&#8221; -
These were the words of his teacher, but he himself felt that a man
must leave a student.<br>
