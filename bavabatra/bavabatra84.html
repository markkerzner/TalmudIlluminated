fellow at an agreed-upon price, that is, the seller agrees to sell a
pile of produce to the buyer at such-and-such price per measure, and
the buyer agrees to take it all, and pay whatever the total comes to,
then if buyer pulled the produce to himself, even though he did not
measure it, he acquired it. Since the price has been agreed upon, the
measurement serves only to calculate the total amount of money owed.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If he only measured it, he did not acquire it. However, this refers
only to the seller. If the buyer measured it, his act of measurement
would constitute lifting, the best possible way of formalizing
acquisition, in which case&nbsp; he would have acquired it even without
pulling it to himself.</span></body></html>
