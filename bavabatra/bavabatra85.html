person's container can formalize acquisition for him in any place &#8211;
except in the public domain.&#8221; Rabbi Yochanan and Resh Lakish both said,
&#8220;Even in the public domain.&#8221;<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
A person's </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> can act as his courtyard to acquire items that are placed in it, provided that the </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> is placed in a domain where the </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;">'s owner has the right to place it. Thus a buyer can acquire items in the seller's domain by placing them in his </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;">, provided that the seller gives him the right to place the </span><span style="font-size: medium;">container</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> there. One can place </span><span style="font-size: medium;">containers</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> in the public domain also &#8211; but not keep them there permanently.<br>
<br>
However, they don't argue. The first ruling is dealing with a public
thoroughfare, and the second &#8211; with the quiet recessed area of the
public domain, to which people step to discuss business.</span></body></html>
