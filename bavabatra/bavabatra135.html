will is found tied to his thigh, so that there is no suspicion of
forgery, the will still has no legal validity. <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

Unless a formal act of acquisition was made before the person's death,
his property automatically passes to the rightful heirs defined by the
Torah. The Sages, however, decreed that a seriously ill person be able
to transfer his property to others by verbal declaration alone. They
did it out of concern that a seriously ill person, fearing that his end
was near, might deteriorate further if he were unable to arrange his
affairs. Thus, his words take effect, and the gift takes effect upon
his death.<br>
<br>
This person, who prepared a will, did not use the verbal declaration
method above, and after his death neither he nor his documents can
effect acquisitions.<br>
