been steeped is considered as water, and the blessing over it is &#8220;Who
created everything with His word,&#8221; but others say that if this water

If he poured three cups of water and when the liquid was decanted four
cups were produced, all agree that it is wine, due to one cup of wine
added from lees. If three cups were produced, all agree that it is
water. They argue only when three and half cups were decanted. The
Sages say that three cups went in and three cups came out, so only one
sixth is wine from lees, while other says that of the three cups that
went in one half cup remained, and two half-cups of wine came out,
making the mixture strong enough.<br>
