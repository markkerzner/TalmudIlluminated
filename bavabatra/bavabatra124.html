benefits that accrue to the father's estate after his death but before
the division, such as a calf born of a cow in the estate, or a loan
repaid to the estate?<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
<i>Rabbis</i>: the firstborn does not take the double portion of that;<br>
<i>Rebbi</i>: the firstborn takes a double portion of those benefits
that happen automatically, but not those that the orphans brought to
the estate through their actions.<br>
<br>
What are their arguments?<br>
<br>
<i>Rabbis</i>: the expression &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">to give him the double portion</a>...&#8221;
compares the double portion to a gift. Just as a gift cannot be given
unless it has come into the donor's possession, so does the double
portion include only present assets.<br>
<br>
<i>Rebbi</i>: the words &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">double portion</a>...&#8221; make the law for both portions the same, to include future automatic benefits.<br>
