</div><span style="font-size: medium;">If the seller says, "I am selling you this amount of land as measured by a rope, be it more or less," - then these two statements are contradictory. <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-104-contract-for-sale-of.html">"Measured by a rope" does not forgive even a slight variation, whereas "be it more or less" forgives a deviation of up to 1/24</a>. The second statement nullifies the first. If it was uttered after a while, it is definitely a retraction. Even if it was uttered right away, we assume that he changed his mind. These are the words of Ben Nannas.<br />
<br />
However, the Sages say that since he added nothing to clarify his retraction, this may indicate that he understood the contradiction and went back to the first statement - and decided to stop talking and making further mistakes. Therefore, the statement which gives the seller the smaller amount is operative, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/11/bava-batra-92-implied-warranty.html">keeping the money in dispute in the hands of the current owner</a>.</span><br />
