selling you this amount of land as measured by a rope, be it more or
less,&#8221; - then these two statements are contradictory. <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-104-contract-for-sale-of.html">&#8220;Measured by a rope&#8221; does not forgive even a slight variation, whereas &#8220;be it more or less&#8221; forgives a deviation of up to 1/24</a>.
The second statement nullifies the first. If it was uttered after a
while, it is definitely a retraction. Even if it was uttered right
away, we assume that he changed his mind. These are the words of Ben
Nannas.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
However, the Sages say that since he added nothing to clarify his
retraction, this may indicate that he understood the contradiction and
went back to the first statement &#8211; and decided to stop talking and
making further mistakes. Therefore, the statement which gives the
seller the smaller amount is operative, <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/11/bava-batra-92-implied-warranty.html">keeping the money in dispute in the hands of the current owner</a>.</span><br>
