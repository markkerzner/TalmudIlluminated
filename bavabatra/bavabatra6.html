two homes are standing on two opposite sides of a public domain, both
owners must make a fence of four amot (about 6 feet) high across half
of his roof. The fences must not be directly opposite each other, but
each must cover the adjoining side, preventing his neighbor from
looking directly into his roof, and preventing him from looking into
his neighbor's roof. Furthermore, the fences must be slightly longer
than half the roof, thus further obstructing the view.<br><br>It would be impractical for each owner to build a fence, and unenforceable to require only one owner to do so.<br><br>Even
though one owner can say, &#8220;What difference does my fence make, the
public sees you anyway?&#8221; - the other one can reply, &#8220;I can hide from
the public by doing my private acts at night, but I can't hide from
you.&#8221;</span></body></html>
