that they should inherit their father's portion in the Land of Israel.
Their argument ran as follows: if they were to be considered for
inheritance, given that they had no brothers, well and good. However,
if they are not considered for inheritance, they should likewise not be
considered for yibum (levirate marriage) &#8211; and then their mother should
be married to a brother of Tzelophchad, who would receive Tzelophchad's
portion, thus bringing it back to the family.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

Moses had to ask God, and their petitioned was granted. Moses would
have written this part of the law anyway, but they were meritorious,
and thus deserved that it was written through them &#8211; because of their
love for the Land of Israel.<br>
