<br>
This was true, however, only for the first generation after entry, because it is introduced with &#8220;..<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-6.htm">this is the thing that God has commanded</a>...&#8221;,
which teaches that this "thing" applies only in this generation. The
reason was to encourage the Jews who entered the Land to conquer all of
it from the Canaanite inhabitants &#8211; and not get it through
intermarriage.<br>
<br>
The daughters of Tzelophchad were given the same commandment, but for them it was just good advice &#8211; because they were <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-4.htm">wise</a>, <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-4.htm">expounders of the Torah</a>, and <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-6.htm">righteous</a>. Nevertheless, <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-11.htm">they followed it</a>. Moreover, a miracle happened to them: they were rejuvenated and married righteous, fitting husbands.</span><br>
