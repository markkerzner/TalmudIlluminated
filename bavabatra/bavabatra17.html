Meir: &#8220;If Abraham had a daughter, he would not want her to marry in
Canaan, and he would not want her to go away, for everywhere they
served idols. He did not have a daughter, and in his case it was a
blessing." Rabbi Yehudah: &#8221;He did have a daughter, and her name was
'Everything' (bakol).&#8221;</span><br>

walls of his pit.</span><br>
