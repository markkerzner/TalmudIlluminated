Why is charity compared to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_%28armour%29">coat of armour</a>? To tell you that just as each scale combines to form a large coat of armour, so with respect to giving charity each coin combines with all others to comprise a large sum, that is, to be considered as a large gift, reflecting more favorably on the donor.<br /><br />One who gives a small coin to a pauper is <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/58-7.htm">blessed with six Heavenly blessings</a>, and one who comforts him with words <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/58-10.htm">gets eleven blessing</a>.<br /><br /></span>
