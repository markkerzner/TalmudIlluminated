To tell you that just as each scale combines to form a large coat of
armour, so with respect to giving charity each coin combines with all
others to comprise a large sum, that is, to be considered as a large
gift, reflecting more favorably on the donor.<br><br>One who gives a small coin to a pauper is <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/58-7.htm">blessed with six Heavenly blessings</a>, and one who comforts him with words <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/58-10.htm">gets eleven blessing</a>.</span></body></html>
