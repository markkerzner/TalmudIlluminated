he must investigate further, to see if he is dealing with a forgotten
graveyard, since the laws for a single corpse and a graveyard differ.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If one finds a corpse in an area not previously known to contain
corpses, lying in its usual manner, he may remove it along with its
surrounding earth, for it may be assumed that it is not a graveyard.
If, however, he found three corpses and there is a space between them
of from four to eight amot, it is considered a graveyard zone and the
corpses may not be relocated. The upper limit of eight amot agrees with
the <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/11/bava-batra-101-selling-burial-plot.html">opinion of Rabbi Shimon on the size of catacombs</a>.</span><br>
