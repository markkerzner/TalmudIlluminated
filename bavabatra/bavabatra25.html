must distance animal carcasses, graves, and a tannery fifty amot (100
feet) from a town, so as not to disturb the town's residents with their
foul order. <br>
<br>
One must distance a flax pool from vegetables and mustard seeds from
the bees of his neighbor. Water from soaking flax is toxic to the
vegetables. Bees digest mustard, and it causes the honey to become
pungent. Alternatively, it causes the bees to consume the honey.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Yosi allows damaging agents to be put in one's property when the
damage is indirect, like in the case of flax and mustard, putting on
the damaged party the obligation to protect itself, and his view
becomes law.</span></body></html>
