</div><span style="font-size: medium;">One who sells a field without specifying what is included in the sale has not sold the water pit, the wine press, and the dovecote in this field, because they are separate properties in their own right. These items are not included in the sale, even if they are in disuse at the time of the sale.<br />
<br />
When one gives the primary item as a gift, he gives it all, and even items not included in the case of sale. A gift recipient is embarrassed to ask about details, and it is on the giver to withhold any items he wants to keep.<br />
<br />
One who consecrates a field is generous like a giver. Rabbi Shimon says, he is like a seller.<br />
