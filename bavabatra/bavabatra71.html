specifying what is included in the sale has not sold the water pit, the
wine press, and the dovecote in this field, because they are separate
properties in their own right. These items are not included in the
sale, even if they are in disuse at the time of the sale.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
When one gives the primary item as a gift, he gives it all, and even
items not included in the case of sale. A gift recipient is embarrassed
to ask about details, and it is on the giver to withhold any items he
wants to keep.<br>
<br>
One who consecrates a field is generous like a giver. Rabbi Shimon says, he is like a seller.</span></body></html>
