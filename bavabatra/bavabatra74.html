<br>
An Arab merchant said to me, &#8220;Come, I will show you Mount Sinai.&#8221; I
went and saw that scorpions surrounded it, and they resembled white
donkeys. I heard a Heavenly voice saying, &#8220;Woe to me (God) that I have
sworn to exile My people; and now that I have sworn, who can annul the
oath for Me?&#8221;<br>
<br>
When Rabbah came back, the Rabbis told him,&nbsp; - Every Abba (his proper
name) is a donkey, and every bar bar Chanah is a fool. You ought to
have declared, &#8220;It is annulled for You.&#8221;<br>
<br>
And Rabbah, what did he think? That perhaps the Heavenly voice was talking about <a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/8-21.htm">the oath about the Flood</a>. <br>
<br>
And the Rabbis? If so, then why did the Heavenly voice say &#8220;Woe is to Me&#8221; about something that is for mankind's good?</span></body></html>
