movable items can be formally acquired by pulling them into the domain
of the buyer. However, this is only true for items that are not
normally lifted. Items that are normally lifted can't be acquired by
pulling at all.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
But is that true? Consider the following case: one who steals a bag of
money on Shabbat by pulling it out of the house is not liable to pay,
since he is liable with his life for carrying on Shabbat. We see that
he does acquire the bag by pulling, even though normally money bags are
lifted! <br>
<br>
Rebuttal: you know what we are dealing with here? A bag that's too big
to be lifted. Therefore, the rule stands, and normally pulling is
ineffective as a method of acquisition if lifting is possible.</span></body></html>
