was generally made solely for that purpose. Hence, the sale of this
building includes all non-movable items used in the pressing process. <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
One who sells the house of an olive press without specifying what is
included in the sale has sold the vat, the crusher (that is used to
pre-soften olives), and the &#8220;maidens&#8221;. These items are automatically
sold with the press because they are attached to the building where the
press is housed.<br>
<br>
However, he has not sold the boards, the wheel, or the beam. These
items are excluded from sale because they are not attached to the
building.<br>

is contained therein,&#8221; he has sold all of these items - but not
unrelated items that are merely being stored in the house.</span></div></body></html>
