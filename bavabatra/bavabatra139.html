and unmarried daughters, when the property of the estate is abundant,
the sons inherit and the daughters are supported (food, clothing, and
wedding expenses). When the property of the estate is meager, the
daughters are supported and the sons go begging at the door.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

According to Biblical law, a person survived by his sons and daughters
is inherited only by his sons. The Sages, however, instituted that a
man stipulate to his wife in her marriage contract (ketubah) that their
daughters who survive him be entitled to support from his estate until
they marry or reach full maturity.<br>
<br>
Admon says, &#8220;Because I am male, do I lose?&#8221; and Rabban Gamliel prefers
his opinion, but the final law follows the first authority &#8211; the
daughters take priority.<br>
