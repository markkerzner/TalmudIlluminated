inherit me,&#8221; where there is a daughter who will survive him, or if he
says &#8220;Let my daughter inherit me,&#8221; where there is a son who will
survive him &#8211; he has said nothing, that is, his words are not
effective, since he made a stipulation contrary to what is written in
the Torah.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
However, if he increased the portion of one son among the other sons,
or one daughter among the other daughters, or completely eliminated the
portion of one son, leaving everything for the other sons, his words
stand. Thus, one can change the the portion of whose who are in the
same order of inheritance. This ruling contradicts <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-126-changing-portions-in.html">the one cited earlier</a>; indeed, it is the opinion of Rabbi Yochanan ben Berokah and is the one accepted in practice.<br>
