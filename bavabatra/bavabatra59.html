into a jointly owned courtyard, since he will be able to observe the
activities of his partners in the courtyard below without their
knowledge, thereby committing visual trespass. <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
The person opening the window could argue to his partner: &#8220;In any event
you need to conceal your actions in the courtyard from me, and windows
will not result in any additional visual trespass.&#8221;<br>
<br>
However, his partner can reply, &#8220;When you were in your house and your
door was closed, I was able to use the courtyard for private
activities. But now, if you open a window to the courtyard, even when
you are in your home, I need to conceal myself from you.&#8221;</span></body></html>
