are you doing in this house?&#8221; The occupant replied, &#8220;I bought it from
you, and I have used it for three years needed to establish chazakah.&#8221;
The original owner replied, &#8220;I was residing in the inner rooms all this
time.&#8221; <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
The litigants came before Rav Nachman, who said to the occupant, &#8220;Prove
your exclusive use of the house by producing witnesses that you lived
there alone, and you will have established chazakah.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Rava said to Rav Nachman, &#8220;Is that the law? The burden of proof rests
upon the one who seeks to exact payment from his fellow, that is, on
the previous owner!&#8221; - but the law is like Rav Nachman, since his view
always prevails over Rava's.</span></body></html>
