from his fellow. There was one witness to the snatching, but the
defendant said, &#8220;Yes, I snatched it, but it was my ingot that I
snatched!&#8221;<br>
</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> <br>
Rabbi Ami considered the case:<br>
<br>
* Should he be required to pay? But there aren't two witnesses!<br>
* Exempt him based on &#8220;Why would he lie?&#8221; &#8211;&nbsp; he could deny having
snatched it altogether? This argument is weakened by the witness.<br>
* Make him swear that he did not snatch it? But he himself admits that he did!<br>
* Make him swear that the ingot was his? We can't concoct oaths!<br>
<br>
Rav Abba offered a solution. The snatcher is obligated to take an oath but can not do so, and all such people must pay.</span></body></html>
