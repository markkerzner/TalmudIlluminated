is only valid in the absence of the alleged owner's protest. If the
owner protests at least once in three years, the occupant is put on
notice, and his chazakah is ineffective. In other words, if the
occupant really bought the field, he should keep the deed, and his
negligence to do so in inexcusable in the face of a protest, thus his
three years of occupancy don't help.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
It is sufficient to protest in front of two witnesses, without the
occupant present. These witnesses have friends, their friends have
friends, and the word travels till it reaches the occupant. If,
however, the owner is in a province that has little communications with
the province where his field is, he will not bother to protest, since
his protest can't reach the occupant anyway, and thus the chazakah
can't be established at all. Example of such regions are Judea and
Galilee, which at the time had little travel between them.</span></body></html>
