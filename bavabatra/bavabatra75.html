acquisition of a ship? Rav says, &#8220;Once the buyer has pulled the ship
even a small distance, he has acquired it.&#8221; But Shmuel says, &#8220;He has
not acquired the ship until he pulls it away completely away from the
place it originally occupied.&#8221;<br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">

Is this the same disagreement as the two views on acquiring an animal
by pulling: (1) the animal is acquired when it raises the front and
hind leg, or (2) only when it walks the full length?<br>
<br>
No, it is not the same! Once the animal starts to move, it will move
the other two legs, but the ship may stop after the initial push. On
the other hand, once a ship is moved, it moves as a whole, whereas an
animal can put its legs back. The two disagreements are different, and
both had to be recorded.</span></body></html>
