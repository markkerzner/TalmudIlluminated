tells two witnesses, &#8220;So-and-so is a thief,&#8221; this is not an effective
protest. If, however, he says, &#8220;So-and-so is a thief, for he has taken
possession of my land through an act of theft and tomorrow I shall
claim it from him in court,&#8221; this is an effective protest. The threat
to sue is not really necessary, but this is how people usually conclude
their protest.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If the protester tells the witnesses, &#8220;Don't tell the occupant that I
lodged a protest,&#8221; we assume that he means not to tell him directly,
but they may tell others. Thus, this protest is effective. If the
witnesses promise on their own, &#8220;Not a word of protest will leave our
mouths,&#8221; there is still a chance that they will reveal it
inadvertently. Only if they are told, &#8220;Keep this completely
confidential,&#8221; can they be relied upon to keep it secret.</span></body></html>
