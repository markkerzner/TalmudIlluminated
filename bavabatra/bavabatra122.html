there are no sons) are equal with respect to inheriting from a mother's
estate and a father's estate. However, there are some differences.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
A son who is a firstborn takes a double portion of his father's estate,
but he does not take a double portion of his mother's estate &#8211; since
&#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">to him is the right of the firstborn</a>&#8221; can be understood to say that &#8220;regarding him, that is, the father, the right of the firstborn applies.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The daughters are supported from the father's estate until they marry, but they are not supported from the mother's estate.<br>
