</div><span style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Abba sent a number of rulings to Rav Yosef. The last of them deals with inheritance.<br />
<br />
* If a defendant made an extralegal offer, like "Swear that this is your slave and take him" - he cannot retract.<br />
* A third-generation cousin can testify regarding a second-generation cousin.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;">* One who knew a testimony about a land boundary, but became blind, cannot testify about it anymore.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"> * If one says, "My wife shall take a share in my estate like one of my sons" - it is as he says. The husband certainly can give her a gift. However, she takes a share only in those properties that he owns now, not in any subsequent acquisitions.<br />
