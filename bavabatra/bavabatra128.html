The last of them deals with inheritance.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
* If a defendant made an extralegal offer, like &#8220;Swear that this is your slave and take him&#8221; - he cannot retract.<br>
* A third-generation cousin can testify regarding a second-generation cousin.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: medium;">* One who knew a testimony about a land boundary, but became blind, cannot testify about it anymore.</span><br>
<span style="font-size: medium;"> * If one says, &#8220;My wife shall take a
share in my estate like one of my sons&#8221; - it is as he says. The husband
certainly can give her a gift. However, she takes a share only in those
properties that he owns now, not in any subsequent acquisitions.<br>
