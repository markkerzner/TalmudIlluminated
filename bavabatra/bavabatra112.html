</div><span style="font-size: medium;">A man inherits his wife, but she does not inherit him. In discussing the laws of inheritance, it says "...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-11.htm">and you shall give his inheritance to â€¦ his flesh and he shall inherit her</a>..." and "his flesh" means his wife, because "...<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/2-24.htm">they shall become one flesh</a>..."<br />
<br />
In connection with this, there was a <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-9.htm">commandment for a Jewish woman to marry only within her tribe</a>. The commandment was in force only during the years of conquest of the Land of Israel. It was applicable only to a woman who could potentially inherit land at the time of marriage - that is, if she had no brothers and was thus her father's prospective heir.<br />
