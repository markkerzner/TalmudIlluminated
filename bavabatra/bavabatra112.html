In discussing the laws of inheritance, it says &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-11.htm">and you shall give his inheritance to &#8230; his flesh and he shall inherit her</a>...&#8221; and &#8220;his flesh&#8221; means his wife, because &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/2-24.htm">they shall become one flesh</a>...&#8221;<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
In connection with this, there was a <a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-9.htm">commandment for a Jewish woman to marry only within her tribe</a>.
The commandment was in force only during the years of conquest of the
Land of Israel. It was applicable only to a woman who could potentially
inherit land at the time of marriage &#8211; that is, if she had no brothers
and was thus her father's prospective heir.<br>
