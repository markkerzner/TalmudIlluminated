who causes indirect damages is not liable to pay, but it is
nevertheless forbidden, and one is liable for them in the Heavenly
court. He may lose the same amount or he may be reincarnated to pay
this karmic debt. This is known from the following case.<br>
<br>
Rav Yosef had date palms, under which blood-letters used to let blood.
The ravens would come and eat blood, then smear it on dates. Rav Yosef
demanded that the blood-letters go elsewhere. Abaye took up their
defense:<br>
<br>
<b>A</b>. But this is only indirect damage!<br>
<b>Y</b>. Doing indirect damage in still forbidden.<br>
<b>A</b>. By being there for three years they have established squatters' rights</span><br>
<span style="font-size: medium;"> <b>Y</b>. There are no squatters' rights for damages.<br>
<b>A</b>. Only for offensive damages such as smoke or an outhouse.<br>
<b>Y</b>. I have a delicate nature, so for me blood on dates is just as offensive.</span></body></html>
