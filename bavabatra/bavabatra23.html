He may lose the same amount or he may be reincarnated to pay this karmic debt. This is known from the following case.<br />
<br />
Rav Yosef had date palms, under which blood-letters used to let blood. The ravens would come and eat blood, then smear it on dates. Rav Yosef demanded that the blood-letters go elsewhere. Abaye took up their defense:<br />
<br />
<b>A</b>. But this is only indirect damage!<br />
<b>Y</b>. Doing indirect damage in still forbidden.<br />
<b>A</b>. By being there for three years they have established squatters' rights</span><br />
<span style="font-size: medium;"> <b>Y</b>. There are no squatters' rights for damages.<br />
<b>A</b>. Only for offensive damages such as smoke or an outhouse.<br />
<b>Y</b>. I have a delicate nature, so for me blood on dates is just as offensive.<br />
