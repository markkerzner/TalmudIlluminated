The phrase &#8220;... <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-17.htm">he must recognize the firstborn</a>...&#8221;
is superfluous, and it is interpreted to mean that the father can
identify the firstborn to others, that is, help them recognize the
firstborn.</span><br></div>
<span style="font-size: medium;"> <br>
If two sons were born in hiding, and it is not clear who is the
firstborn, they can appoint each other an agent against other brothers,
and together win the portion of the firstborn &#8211; so did Rava advise.
They told Rava that even though it sounded logical, the Torah insists
on a definite knowledge about a firstborn, and that Rabbi Yannai
explained this to be true only when the firstborn was known and then
mixed up. The next day Rava publicly announced: &#8220;The statement that I
made previously was an error on my part.&#8221;<br>
