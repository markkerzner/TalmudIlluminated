and she bought it with money that he knew nothing about till now, he
can claim that he only wanted to discover the source of her hidden

The best way to sell the field to one's wife is to write both terms in
the contract, &#8220;the field is sold to you&#8221; and &#8220;the field is given to
you.&#8221; The sale term will help her if the field is repossessed by the
husband's lenders &#8211; by giving her the right to be reimbursed by the
husband. The term &#8220;given&#8221; will help&nbsp; against a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/08/immediate-neighbor-of-property-has.html">neighbor's&nbsp; right to buy an adjoining field</a>. </span></body></html>
