indebtedness to his fellow must write for him a document of sale, which
states, &#8220;Acquire the promissory note and whatever lien is in it.&#8221; If he
did not do so, the buyer acquired only the paper on which it is
written, for use such as a bottle-stopper. The sale would then become
void because of the law against overcharge.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

If one says to his fellow, &#8220;Sell me this yoke for 200 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuz_%28Jewish_coin%29">zuz</a>,&#8221;
then it is obvious that the yoke alone is not sold for this amount, and
thus the oxen are included. But the Sages say, &#8220;The purchase price is
no proof.&#8221; It may be viewed as gratuity that the buyer gives to the
seller, or the overpayment, in which case the sale would be voidable.</span></body></html>
