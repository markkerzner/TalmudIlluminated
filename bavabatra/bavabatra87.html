to his fellow, and after the price was fixed, the merchandise
appreciated or depreciated, who stands to gains or lose? <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If the price changed before the measure was full, it changed for the
seller. If it rose, the seller can retract and insist on a higher
price. If it fell, the buyer can retract and hold out for a lower
price. Once the measure is filled, the buyer acquires the merchandise
and the deal is final. <br>
<br>
But how can this ruling be true? If the container belongs to the
seller, he owns the merchandise until the buyer takes delivery. And if
it belongs to the buyer, he acquires every measure as it is poured in.
The answer is that the container belongs to a middleman, who loans it
to the seller while filling, then loans it to the buyer after it's full.</span></body></html>
