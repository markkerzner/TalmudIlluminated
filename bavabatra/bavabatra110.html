From &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/27-8.htm">if a man dies... and he has no son, then you shall pass his estate to his daughter</a>...&#8221;
This implies that the reason the daughter would inherit is because the
deceased has no son; but if he had a son, the son would precede her.<br>
<br>
Brothers inherit from each other and bequeath to each other &#8211; provided
that they are brothers from the same father. Brothers related only
through their mother are not connected for inheritance. This is derived
from &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/1-2.htm">according to their families, according to their fathers' households</a>...&#8221; <br>
