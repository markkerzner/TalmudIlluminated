several people in turn by saying, &#8220;My properties shall be given to you
upon my death, and after you die, so-and-so shall inherit it, and after
he dies, so-and-so shall inherit it,&#8221; the law is as follows:<br></div><span style="font-size: 12pt;">
<br>
When the first beneficiary dies, the second beneficiary acquires the
property. When the second beneficiary dies, the third beneficiary
acquires the property. If the second beneficiary dies during the
lifetime of the first one, the property reverts to the heirs of the
first beneficiary upon his death.<br>
<br>
Even though the award was referred to as &#8220;inheritance,&#8221; it was only
valid because he &#8220;gave&#8221; to the first one. Thus, when the second
beneficiary died, he could not &#8220;give&#8221; anything to the third one, and
the normal order of inheritance was restored.<br>
