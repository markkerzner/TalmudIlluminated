the mortar &#8211; if that mortar was carved in a stone that formed part of
the house's wall. However, if the mortar was made from an unattached
piece of wood or stone and then attached to the ground, such mortar is
not included in the sale.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
Rabbi Eliezer says, &#8220;Anything attached to the ground is considered as the ground. Therefore, he has sold the mortar.&#8221;<br>
<br>
What would the Sages say in regard to food placed on this mortar if the
mortar is ritually impure? Is it part of the house and thus part of the
ground for ritual laws, even if not for commerce, and then the food is
pure, or is the mortar not part of the ground for both selling and
ritual, and the food is impure? - This remains unresolved.</span></body></html>
