<br>
If someone says to one of them, &#8220;Give me back my cloak, which I gave
you to repair,&#8221; he answers, &#8220;It never happened.&#8221; And if the claimant
persists, &#8220;But I have witnesses who saw it in your possession!&#8221; - he
retorts, &#8220;That cloak which they saw was a different one.&#8221;<br>
<br>
And if the claimant says, &#8220;Produce the cloak in order to ascertain if
it is, in fact, mine,&#8221; - the craftsman says to him, &#8220;I will not produce
the cloak because of your unfounded claims, as it would be unfair to
the owner.&#8221;</span></body></html>
