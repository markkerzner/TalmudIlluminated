money, he acquires the object. The Sages, however, established that
movable objects should be acquired by lifting, pulling into one's
domain, or taking control over them. Until the buyer takes delivery of
his purchase, the seller, who already got paid, may not be careful to
protect it. If, however, the object is still the seller's until
delivery, he will be careful.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If the ship is on public grounds, one cannot pull it into his domain,
therefore, the seller can give control over it to the buyer. If the
ship is in an area which people can use as their own, the buyer should
pull the ship into his domain. If the ship is not afloat, one can lift
it or rent the area under it.</span></body></html>
