one sold his land and retained the trees on it for himself, he has a
certain amount of land around the trees, so that if his trees die, he
is entitled to plant others. <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
Does this not contradict Rabbi Akiva's ruling that a seller sells
generously, which we have learned from the following: when one sells a
house or a field, but not a well located in its midst, then <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/10/bava-batra-64-does-seller-sell-with.html">Rabbi Akiva
says that he sells the entire house, leaving himself no right-of-way in
it at all?</a><br>
<br>
In fact, even Rabbi Akiva would agree to the ruling about trees. The
tree weakens the surrounding soil, and the seller worries that if the
tree dies, the buyer may tell him, &#8220;Uproot your tree and be gone!&#8221; and
thus the seller reserves land around the trees for himself.</span></body></html>
