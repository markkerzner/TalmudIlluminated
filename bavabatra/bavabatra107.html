inherited land, thinking that they were the only heirs, and then a
third brother came from overseas, their original division is void.
Inheritors are considered as if they bought their respective portions
from each other, so it was a mistaken sale, and they will have to
redivide. The same law applies when their father's creditor collected
land from one of the brothers.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

If three judges came to appraise land belonging to orphans, in order to
satisfy their debts, and disagreed about the value of the land,
claiming respective values of 80, 105, and 120, the land is worth 105.
Two against one consider it worth less than 105, and two against one
consider it worth more than 105. Other approaches include throwing away
the highest value or considering that the judge mentally adjusts his
estimate to be closer to his friends' numbers.<br>
