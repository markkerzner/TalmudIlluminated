<br>
However, we have the following a forteriori (kav vachomer) argument. &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/36-8.htm">and any daughter who inherits  a legacy from the tribes of the children of Israel</a>...&#8221;
is talking about the inheritance coming to a daughter from her mother.
Now, the daughter does not inherit from her father, and nevertheless
inherits from her mother. The son, who inherits from his father, surely
inherits from his father, and even preempts the daughter.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Zecharia Hakatzav says that an a forteriori argument cannot give
the son more rights than the daughter, and they should share in the
inheritance equally &#8211; however the final law does not follow him.<br>
