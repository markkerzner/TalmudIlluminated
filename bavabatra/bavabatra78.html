Nachum the Mede, however, says, he has sold his gear, too. <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

All agree that the saddle, the blanket, the girth that goes under
donkey's belly, and the breast strap are sold. These are necessary for
the use of the donkey. They argue about the sack and saddlebag, which
are specifically cargo gear. The first teacher holds that ordinarily a
donkey is used for riding, and the cargo gear is therefore not included
in the sale. Nachum holds that ordinarily a donkey is used for
transporting cargo, and therefore its cargo gear is included in the
sale.<br>
<br>
Is the argument about the gear that is on the donkey, or the gear that
is not? This question remains unresolved, and the one who wants to
extract money from his fellow needs to prove his right.</span></body></html>
