All tax and civil laws that prevail in a country have legal force in
Jewish court, since the country's citizenry voluntarily accepts upon
itself to abide by the government's laws. Thus, a Jew who takes
possession of property according to the provisions of local law is not
guilty of theft even if the Torah law would consider the property
belonging to another Jew. This applies, however, only to the laws
sanctioned by the constitution of the country but not when monarchy
appropriates property by force.<br>

Although in Persia only recorded real estate transactions were
recognized as valid, anyone who occupied a property for forty years was
considered to be its legitimate owner.</span></body></html>
