wine that is sold in shops still retains the blessing over wine, that
is, &#8220;Who created the fruit of the vine.&#8221; Rav Zevid said, &#8220;Why should I
say a blessing over wine that has soured? Rather, the blessing is &#8220;Who
created everything by His word.&#8221; Rav Yehudah agrees about wine sold on
the corners, which the thirsty indiscriminate public consumes in haste,
that it is not wine at all.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If one bought a barrel of wine and it spoiled withing three days, then
Rav says that it was beginning to spoil at the time of the sale, and
therefore it is a mistaken purchase, which can be returned. Shmuel says
that &#8220;it is on his shoulders.&#8221; This means either that it spoiled while
being carried, or that the spoilage is due to the sins of the owner.<br>
