property becomes a guarantee for his repayment of the loan, but not his
movables. Even if he promises to repay with &#8220;the shirt on his back,&#8221;
still, if he does not have that shirt, he can't repay with it. However,
even if he sold the field in the interim, physically the field is still
there, and the lender can repossess it.<br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">

Because of that, the seller of a field cannot testify on behalf of the
buyer. If someone can prove that the seller never owned the field and
he is in fact a thief, then that field is not a guarantee for the
seller's loans, and the seller becomes a &#8220;bad person who borrows and
does not repay&#8221; - a situation that people try to avoid.</span></body></html>
