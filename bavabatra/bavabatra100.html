through his field (either it was owned by the public from before, or he
ceded it to the public) &#8211; and then he took that path for himself and
gave the public another path at the side of the field, he may not take
the new path back, but the original one does not become his.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
The standard width of a private path is 4 amot (6 ft), public
thoroughfare &#8211; 16, and standing&nbsp; ceremony &#8211; 4 kavs (60x60 ft). As
people were walking from the cemetery, the leader would say &#8220;Stand,
dear ones, stand.&#8221; Then he would say, &#8220;Sit, dear ones, sit,&#8221; and they
would sit and bemoan their loss. This was done seven times,
corresponding to <a href="http://bible.cc/ecclesiastes/1-2.htm">seven &#8220;futilities&#8221; in Ecclesiastes</a>&nbsp; and<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/8-22.htm"> seven components in the cycle of times</a>.</span><br>
