selling a field of a certain size, and he also identified the field by
its landmarks and boundaries, he has made two contradictory statements.
&#8220;Within these landmarks and boundaries&#8221; means selling as is, no matter
what the size. The fact that he added the size of the field compels him
to at least come close to this size.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If the field was found to be of a different size, then if the
difference is less than a sixths, the field becomes the buyer's without
any adjustment. If the difference is greater than a sixth, they have to
make an adjustment, with the seller or the buyer paying the difference.<br>
<br>
This 1/6 is not the same <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/06/bava-metzia-50-both-seller-and-buyer.html">as overcharge</a>, since <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/06/bava-metzia-56-things-not-subject-to.html">there is no overcharge law for land</a>. Rather, it is an estimate of what people forgive.<br>
