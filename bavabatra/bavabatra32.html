are you doing on this land?&#8221; The other one replied &#8220;I bought it from
you and here is the deed.&#8221; The challenger said &#8220;It is a forged deed
and, as you don't claim to have chazakah, you must vacate the property.&#8221;<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
The occupant leaned over and whispered to Rabbah, &#8220;Yes, it is a forged
document. However, I originally had a valid deed, and it got lost. I
wanted to bring some document to court.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Rabbah said, &#8220;Why would he lie?&#8221; He could have said that the deed was
valid&nbsp; and he would be believed (either the forgery was very good, or
the deed was given before the sale). <br>
<br>
Generally &#8220;Why would he lie?&#8221; is believed, but the claimant must take a Rabbinically imposed oath that he is saying the truth.</span></body></html>
