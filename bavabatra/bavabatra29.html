ditches, and bathhouses - or any other property that yields benefits
continually - is established after three years of uncontested occupancy
from day to day. For other properties it depends on their normal use,
for example, a presumptive ownership for a field is established after
harvesting three crops.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

Why three years? For three years after purchasing a property, a person
is careful with his deed, but longer than that he is not careful to
keep his deed unless his occupancy of the property has been challenged.
Therefore, after three years of the unchallenged use of a property, we
do not insist that the occupant produce documentary proof of his
ownership; rather, we rely on his very occupancy as proof.</span></body></html>
