properties to another, and the recipient protests that he does not want
the gift, the protest is valid, and the gift reverts back to the donor.
The recipient claim is not spurious and is based on &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/15-27.htm">one who hates gifts will live</a>.&#8221; <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If the recipient was at first silent and later protested, his protest is invalid, and he remains in the possession of the gift.<br>
<br>
If the donor asked a third party to acquire the gift on behalf of the
recipient, the acquisition act is valid, since it is assumed that most
people do want gifts. If the recipient was at first silent and then
protested, then some say that he acquired the gift, but some say that
perhaps he saw no need to protest until the gift actually reaches his
hands, and thus the situation is in doubt.<br>
