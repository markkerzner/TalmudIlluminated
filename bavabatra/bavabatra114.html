<br>
Whenever this happens, parties are entitled to retract for a certain
period of time. For how long? Rabbah said, &#8220;As long as they are seated
at the same location.&#8221; Rav Yosef said, &#8220;As long as there are talking
about the same subject.&#8221;<br>
<br>
However, both Rabbah and Rav Yosef have a problem with the rule learned previously about a <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/12/bava-batra-113-inheritance-to-be.html">court executing the last will</a>.
If a sick person can retract, none of their decisions are valid! Rav
Yosef answers that this rule is only applicable while they are still
talking about the subject of inheritance.<br>
