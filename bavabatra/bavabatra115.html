Moreover, all the descendants of a son take precedence over a daughter. <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
However, a daughter takes precedence over the brothers of the deceased
(her uncles), and the descendants of a daughter take precedence over
brothers. The daughter also takes precedence over the father of the
deceased (her grandfather).<br>
<br>
This is the rule: whoever takes precedence in the inheritance, his
descendants too take precedence; and the father takes precedence over
all his descendants &#8211; because the brothers of the deceased are related
to him through their common father.<br>
