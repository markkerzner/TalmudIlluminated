succession, each one for a year, they combine to establish a chazakah
against the original owner &#8211; provided that their purchases were
recorded in deeds. The original owner can't claim that the quick
succession of owners was a proof of their illegitimate occupancy,
without him needing to protest. Rather, the public knowledge of their
sales should have caused his protest.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
Some people have legitimate access to other people's property, so they
can never establish chazakah, even if they have the movables in their
possession, or if they occupy the real property. Thus, craftsmen,
sharecroppers, and property administrators cannot establish a chazakah.
So too a husband cannot establish a chazakah in his wife's property,
nor can a wife establish a chazakah in her husband property, nor a
father in his son's property, nor a son in his father's property.</span></body></html>
