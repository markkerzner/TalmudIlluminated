</div><span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implied_warranty">Sold products are expected to be fit for the purpose</a>.  However, if one sold produce to his fellow without specifying whether he is selling it for planting or eating, and the buyer planted it, but it did not grow - the seller is not responsible for the loss.  This is true even for flaxseed, which is usually purchased for planting. <br />
<br />
Normally, the law follows the principle of majority, assuming that the situation at hand is typical of the majority of such cases. However, in money matters there is another principle that "<b><i>to extract money from his fellow, the burden of proof lies with the claimant</i></b>," and it trumps the principle of majority. Since the buyer cannot definitely prove his claim, the seller does not have to refund the purchase amount.<br />
