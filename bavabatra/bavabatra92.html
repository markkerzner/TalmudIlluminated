However, if one sold produce to his fellow without specifying whether
he is selling it for planting or eating, and the buyer planted it, but
it did not grow &#8211; the seller is not responsible for the loss.&nbsp; This is
true even for flaxseed, which is usually purchased for planting. <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

Normally, the law follows the principle of majority, assuming that the
situation at hand is typical of the majority of such cases. However, in
money matters there is another principle that &#8220;<b><i>to extract money from his fellow, the burden of proof lies with the claimant</i></b>,&#8221;
and it trumps the principle of majority. Since the buyer cannot
definitely prove his claim, the seller does not have to refund the
purchase amount.<br>
