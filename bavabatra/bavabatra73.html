specifying exactly what is included in the sale, has sold the mast, the
sail, the anchor, and the oars. He has not sold the ship's slaves, nor
the cargo. If he said, &#8220;I am selling the ship and all that is in it,&#8221; -
all of these are included.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

Said Rabbah bar bar Channah: &#8220;Those that go down to the sea told me
that the wave that sinks a ship appears to have a fringe of white fire
at its tip. But when one strikes it with a club upon which the
following names of God are engraved, I Shall Be What I Shall Be, Yah,
God of Legions, Forever &#8211; it subsides.&#8221;<br>
<br>
He also said, &#8220;I myself saw a frog the size of the city of Akra. A sea
monster came and swallowed it, and a female raven swallowed the sea
monster. It flew up and sat on the branch of a tree. Come and see how
strong that tree was!&#8221;</span></body></html>
