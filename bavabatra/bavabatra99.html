within the house of his fellow (he either inherited it or bought it
along with rights of access) may enter to draw water only at the time
when people usually enter, that is, during the day. He may not bring
his animal and give it to drink directly from the pit, but he must fill
a container and give the animal to drink outside.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
The pit owner makes a lock for the cistern, and the homeowner makes his
lock. The owner of the cistern &#8211; so that the homeowner would not rob
him of his water. The homeowner &#8211; to avoid suspicions of impropriety
concerning his wife.</span><br>
