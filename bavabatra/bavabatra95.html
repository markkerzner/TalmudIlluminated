stated that when one sells a wine cellar, the buyer has to accept 10%
of barrels that began to sour. But compare it to the following.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If a seller says, &#8220;I am selling you A cellar of wine,&#8221; - he must give
the buyer wine which is all good. If he says, &#8220;I am selling you THIS
cellar of wine,&#8221; meaning AS IS, he may give the buyer wine of quality
as sold in stores for immediate consumption, that is, souring wine. <br>
<br>
So when does the buyer accept 10% inferior wine? When the seller said
&#8220;as is,&#8221; but the buyer mentioned that he needs wine for cooking &#8211; which
means that it will be used slowly over time. &#8220;As is&#8221; allows all souring
wine, but &#8220;for cooking&#8221; requires no more than 10%.<br>
