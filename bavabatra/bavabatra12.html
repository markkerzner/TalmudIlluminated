large does a jointly owned field has to be in order for one partner to
compel the other to dissolve the partnership? - Each partner must
receive at least an area that takes a full day to plow; a field must be
at least that large to be cultivated profitably. Oxen had to be rented
for a full day even if they were needed for only part of the day. It
was thus unprofitable to rent them for less than a full day's work.<br><br>After the Temple was destroyed, prophecy was taken from the prophets and given to young children.</span></body></html>
