specifying what is included in the sale has sold the houses, pits,
ditches, and vaults, the bathhouses, the dovecotes, and the olive
presses, but he has not sold the movable property that is in town, such
as household implements and food, because he plans to take these with
him.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
However, if he said, &#8220;I am selling you the town and all that is
contained therein,&#8221; then even if there were animals and slaves in the
town at the time of the sale, they are sold along with the town.<br>
<br>
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, &#8220;He has sold even the <i>santer</i>.&#8221; What is a <i>santer</i>
is a matter of dispute: either a town clerk, a slave owned by the city,
who kept information on boundaries and ownership of properties, or the
fields that immediately surround the city.</span></body></html>
