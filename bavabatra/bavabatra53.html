upon, some indication of the seller's readiness to transfer property is
necessary. This can be accomplished by the seller instructing the buyer
to go and <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/10/bava-batra-52-two-meanings-of-chazakah.html">perform an act of chazakah</a>
upon the land. But where the seller is present, he does not have to say
anything, and his silence alone indicates his acquiescence.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

What is the rule for a gift?<br>
<br>
Rav says that the giver gives the gift generously, out of fondness for
recipient, so no further instruction is necessary, and the chazakah can
be performed in his absence. Shmuel says that since the giver receives
no money, certainly his instruction is required. Actually, Shmuel
agrees that the gift is given generously. However, here possibly no
gift is being given at all.</span></body></html>
