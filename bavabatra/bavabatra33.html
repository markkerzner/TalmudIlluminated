Bar Sharshum that he was using land that belonged to orphans. Abbaye
said to him, &#8220;Tell me, what are the circumstances?&#8221; <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
Rava explained, &#8220;I was holding their father's land as security for loan
repayment and collecting the harvest. When the loan was thus completely
paid, I still kept the land, because their father owed me another loan.&#8221;<br>
<br>
&#8220;Had I returned the land, I would&nbsp; be able to collect the second loan only with an oath, and it is proper to <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">avoid even truthful oaths</a>.&nbsp;
You should believe me on the strength of the 'Why would he lie?'
argument, for I could have said a better lie, that I bought that land.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Abbaye ruled, &#8220;The rumor functions as protest and ruins your chazakah,
the three years of which count only without protests. Therefore, return
the land.&#8221;</span></body></html>
