he is believed. What is the practical consequence of this ruling? If it
is to make him inherit, then this is obvious since the father could
have given him a present. Rather, it is to make the man's wife free
from the obligation of levirate marriage to his brothers.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If one says, &#8220;This is my brother&#8221; - the other brothers don't have to
believe him and share their inheritance with the newcomer. The one who
recognized the brother, however, is obligated to share in the
inheritance. If the newly known brother dies, his properties revert to
the one who identified him, but not shared with other brothers.
However, if the new brother inherits or acquired new properties, the
other brothers inherit them. How could it be? Because they said, &#8220;We
don't know.&#8221;<br>
