was customary to bury the dead in catacombs. A subterranean chamber
would be dug first. Recesses were then dug into the walls of the
chamber, and the dead were places in these recesses. Catacombs serving
as family burial places contained several chambers with multiple
recesses.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
One who sells a lot to his fellow to make a catacomb for him upon it,
or one who accepts a contract to make such a catacomb must adhere to
the following standards: each crypt has to be 4x6 amot; he must open
eight recesses, three on one side, three on another, and two in the
middle opposite the door; the length of each recess must be eight amot,
and the height &#8211; seven hand-breadths. Rabbi Shimon says, 4x8 amot. An
amah (arm) is between 1.5 and 2 feet.</span><br>
