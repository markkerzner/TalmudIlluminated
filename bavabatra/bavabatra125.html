family, &#8220;My property shall go to my grandmother upon my death, and
after her lifetime, it shall go to my heirs.&#8221; The donor had an only
daughter, who was married, but she died during the lifetime of her
husband and her father's grandmother, and then the husband came forward
and claimed the estate.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
Ran Huna said, &#8220;To my heirs&#8221; means &#8220;even to the heirs of my heirs,&#8221; and
so the husband inherits. Ran Anan said, &#8220;To my heirs&#8221; means &#8220;but not to
the heirs of my heirs,&#8221; and so the husband does not inherit. And the
law is like Rav Anan, but not for his reason. Rather, the husband does
not inherit here, because it is only a prospective asset for him, since
the grandmother could have prevented the inheritance by selling the
property.<br>
