</div><span style="font-size: medium;">Since young people do not know the value of land, they can be easily deceived by money offers. The Sages therefore instituted that one can not sell land inherited from a father until one is twenty. In addition, to accomplish a sale one needs to be physically mature. This usually happens at 12 for girls and at 13 for boys, but may come later.<br />
<br />
One person in Bnei Brak sold land he inherited from his father and later died. The members of the father's family challenged the sale, saying that the seller had been a minor at the time of this death. Everyone admitted that he was twenty, but the family claimed that he did not have two pubic hairs.<br />
<br />
Rabbi Akiva told them, "Firstly, you are not permitted to defile him through an examination. Secondly, it won't help, since signs of maturity change after death."<br />
