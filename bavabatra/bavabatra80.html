dovecote from his fellow,&nbsp; he must allow the first pair of doves that
is produced to fly with the mother &#8211; that is, to remain with her; they
are not included in the sale.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
It is the tendency of doves to lay a pair of eggs almost every month of
the year. These eggs hatch and produce one male and one female, which
themselves begin to mate at the age of two months.<br>
<br>
In order to stay in the dovecote, the mother must have, in addition to
her mate, her daughter as a companion. The daughter, too, must have her
offspring as companions, since her mother is not company enough. The
buyer must, therefore, leave all these pairs and not take them for
himself.</span></body></html>
