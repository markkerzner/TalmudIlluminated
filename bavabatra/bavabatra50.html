in the property of a married woman. If someone occupies her property
for three years without her protest, she can say that she expected her
husband to protest, so her absence of protest is of no consequence. She
does not have to protest her husband's use of her land either. However,
if her husband ruins her field with ditches &#8211; she has to protest, for
otherwise her absence of protest will be interpreted as an admission
that he had bought the land.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

In general, however, one can't establish the right to damaging
behavior. For example, if one installs a kiln that emits heavy smoke,
he cannot claim to have established a chazakah. The neighbor can
protest and block this after any period of time. The same applies to an
outhouse, if its odor disturbs the neighbor.</span></body></html>
