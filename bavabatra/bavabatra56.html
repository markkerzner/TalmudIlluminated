behalf of a person that he used a property for three years, and they
were found to be false witnesses, they pay the original owner
everything.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
Ordinarily, when two pairs of witnesses offer conflicting testimony,
the result is a stalemate; the court does not know which pair to
believe. However, when the second pair impugns the first pair's ability
to have witnessed the event altogether, the second pair is believed,
and the first witnesses are designated false (plotters). Whatever
penalty they sought to impose against their victim is assessed against
them.<br>
<br>
In our case, they sought to deprive the original owner of the field by
falsely testifying that the occupant has established a chazakah.
Accordingly, they must pay the value of the field to the owner, who
receives these punitive damages in addition to the field itself, which
he retrieves from the occupant.</span></body></html>
