of earth as measured by a rope,&#8221; it is understood that he means to sell
precisely that amount of land &#8211; no less and no more. If the buyer later

Although in the sale of movable items a small deviation voids the
purchase, the Sages assessed that in the case of real estate the buyer
wants the sale to stand, even if the quantity is slightly more or less,
as long as he is compensated for the difference. If the seller gave him
more than a beit kor, the buyer has to return the excess land. If the
seller said, &#8220;beit kor, be it less or more,&#8221; the sale stands, provided
that the discrepancy is no more than 1/24.<br>
