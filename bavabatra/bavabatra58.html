boundaries of burial crypts by measuring them inside, so that people
would not inadvertently walk over them and contract ritual impurity.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
When he reached the crypt of Abraham, he found Eliezer, the servant of
Abraham, one of the seven righteous people who never died. Rav Bana'ah
asked, &#8220;What is Abraham doing?&#8221; and Eliezer replied, &#8220;He is lying in
the arms of Sarah, and she is peering at his head.&#8221; This symbolizes the
true union of Abraham and Sarah, which transcended the physical
limitations of their earthly marriage. <br>
<br>
Eliezer announced Rav Bana'ah, and Abraham said, &#8220;Let him enter. It is
well known that there is no physical desire in this world.&#8221; Rav Banaah
surveyed the dimensions and departed.</span></body></html>
