<br>
<i><b>The rule</b></i><br>
<br>
A convert is <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/04/bava-kamma-110.html">like a new-born child</a>:
he has severed connection with his old family, and if he has not
created a new one yet, he has no inheritors. One who spreads out mats
on the ownerless land of a deceased convert and lies down upon them has
acquired the land.<br>
<br>
<i><b>Proof</b></i><br>
<br>
One can acquire a Canaanite slave by means of a propriety act, such as
having the slave put on a shoe for him, remove his shoe, or lift him.
We see that supporting the weight is a propriety act &#8211; and so it is
with land: spreading the mats and lying down on it constitutes a
proprietary act. <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2008/10/kiddushin-23-can-canaanite-slave-woman.html">Compare this to a slave woman.</a></span></body></html>
