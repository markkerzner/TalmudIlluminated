<br>
But we have learned a rule that a person may not pour water or urine at
the side of his fellow's wall closer than three hand-breadths from the
wall! Answers Rabbah: pouring from a pot is not allowed, but urinating
is. <br>
<br>
But another rule states that a person may not urinate next to his
fellow's brick wall closer than 3 hand-breadths and 1 hand-breadth from
a stone wall! Rabbah is disproved. But he quoted a verse! The verse is
saying that Achav will not even have dogs.</span></body></html>
