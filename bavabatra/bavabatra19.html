It is thus written "...<a href="http://bible.cc/1_kings/21-21.htm">in the house of Achav every one who urinates against a wall</a>...", meaning every male, which implies that this is a normal practice.<br />
<br />
But we have learned a rule that a person may not pour water or urine at the side of his fellow's wall closer than three hand-breadths from the wall! Answers Rabbah: pouring from a pot is not allowed, but urinating is. <br />
<br />
But another rule states that a person may not urinate next to his fellow's brick wall closer than 3 hand-breadths and 1 hand-breadth from a stone wall! Rabbah is disproved. But he quoted a verse! The verse is saying that Achav will not even have dogs.<br />
