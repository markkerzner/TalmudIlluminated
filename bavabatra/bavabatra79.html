its foal, but if one sold a cow, he has not sold its calf. If one sold
a dump, he has sold its manure. If one sold a pit, he has sold its
waters. If one sold a beehive, he has sold the bees. If one sold a
dovecote, he has sold the doves. In all these cases, the contents are
considered subsidiary to and are sold along with the primary item that
contains them.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

Why is a donkey different from a cow? In this case, he said, &#8220;I am
selling you a nursing donkey.&#8221; For the cow, this may be interpreted as
buying the cow for its milk, but the non-kosher milk of a donkey is
useless to the buyer, and therefore the "nursing" adds its foal to the
sale.</span></body></html>
