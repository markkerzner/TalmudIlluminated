a claim is not a meaningful chazakah and does not entitle the occupant
to keep the property. How so?<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If the previous owner said to the occupant, &#8220;What are you doing in my
property?&#8221; - and the occupant replied, &#8220;I am here because nobody ever
said anything to me,&#8221; - his chazakah is not meaningful and he must
vacate the property.<br>
<br>
If, however, the occupant replied, &#8220;You sold this land to me,&#8221; or &#8220;You
gave it to me as a gift,&#8221; or &#8220;Your father sold it to me,&#8221; or &#8220;Your
father gave it to me as a gift,&#8221; - it is a meaningful chazakah and the
occupant keeps the property. One who comes into a property by way of
inheritance does not require a supporting claim.</span></body></html>
