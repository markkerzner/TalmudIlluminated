properties over to his son &#8220;from today and after I die&#8221; and the son
sells them during his father's lifetime and then dies, then Rabbi
Yochanan says that the buyer does not acquire those properties, but
Resh Lakish says that the buyer acquires them. Rabbi Yochanan considers
the ownership of the rights to the produce tantamount to ownership of
the property itself. Therefore the father, who uses the property and is
the primary owner, prevents the sale. Resh Lakish disagrees about this
premise.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
If one says, &#8220;My property shall go to you, and after you to so-and-so,&#8221;
then the first one can sell it, and the second one has no recourse.
However, initially the first one should not sell it. One who gives him
advice to sell, since after the fact the second one has no recourse, is
called a &#8220;smart bad person.&#8221;</span><br>
