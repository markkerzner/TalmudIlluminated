<br>
For example, if one sells a house to his fellow and says to him, &#8220;I am
selling you this house with the stipulation that the fenced rooftop is
mine&#8221; - the fenced rooftop is his. The clause &#8220;rooftop is mine&#8221; is
redundant. It is already his, as <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/10/bava-batra-60-when-one-buys-house.html">we have learned before</a>. Therefore, this clause is reinterpreted to give him additional rights.<br>
<br></span><span style="font-size: medium;">Exactly which rights he gets is
subject to a dispute: either that he may project beams from the roof
into the adjacent yard, or that he may rebuild it if it collapses, with
the second view prevailing.</span></body></html>
