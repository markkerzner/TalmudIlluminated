fellow, or one who accepts a contract from his fellow regarding a lot,
to construct for him a wedding house for his son or a widowhood house
for his daughter, he must build a house measuring at least four elbows
by six &#8211; these are the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Ishmael, however,
says, &#8220;This is nothing but a cattle barn!&#8221;<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

Incidentally this ruling teaches that it is not proper for a son-in-law
to live in the house of his father-in-law. Rather, the father of the
groom would usually build a small annex adjoining his own house, where
the newly wed couple could live. This accords with the teaching from
the book of Ben Sira: &#8220;Lighter than bran is the son-in-law who lives in
his father-in-law's house. Still lighter is a guest who invites another
guest. And lighter yet is one who gives an answer before he has heard
the question."<br>
