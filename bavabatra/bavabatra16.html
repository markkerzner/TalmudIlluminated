Satan was allowed to inflict extreme pain on Job's body without
allowing him to die, it was most difficult for him, similar to a
servant told by his master, &#8220;Break a keg of wine but save the wine
within it.&#8221;<br><br>The intentions of Satan were for the sake of Heaven.
When Satan saw that the Holy One, Blessed be He, was partial to Job, he
said to himself, &#8220;God forbid that He will forget the mercy He has for
Abraham.&#8221; Therefore he set out to demonstrate Job's failings.<br><br>Rav Acha bar Yakov taught this in the town of Papunia, and the Satan came and kissed his feet in appreciation.</span></body></html>
