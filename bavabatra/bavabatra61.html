promulgated for the architectural styles, usages, and practices of
these days. All such regulations depend on the prevailing custom in any

If one sells a house, without specifying what is included in the sale,
he has not sold the annex, even it is opens into the house, nor has he
sold a storeroom in the rear of the house (such storeroom served as a
storage area for valuables and did not function&nbsp; as part of the living
area of the house), nor has he sold the rooftop if it has a parapet
around it at least ten hand-breads high.</span></body></html>
