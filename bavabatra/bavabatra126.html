firstborn son, shall not take a double portion of my estate,&#8221; or
&#8220;So-and-so, my son, shall not inherit with his brothers,&#8221; - he has said
nothing, that is, his directives are not followed, because he has made
a stipulation contrary to what is written in the Torah.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
However, if one distributes his property before his death, increasing
the share of one and decreasing the share of the other, or making the
portion of the firstborn equal to those of the other brothers &#8211; his
words stand, because he conveyed the portions of his estate as gifts
rather than bequests.<br>
<br>
If at any point in a document, whether at the beginning, the middle, or
the end, one wrote that the awards are conveyed as &#8220;gifts,&#8221; even though
the document also contains language of inheritance, his words stand. <br>
