secret cannot be used to collect the gift. The giver may have already
given the property to someone else, and is now hiding from the first
recipient, and then the gift is not his to give. Or, he may write this
gift document to fool all later recipients of this property. Because of
these suspicions, a secret gift document is considered void.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

One woman said to a man, &#8220;I will marry you only if you give me all your
property.&#8221; His son wanted a share. The man then told witnesses, &#8220;First
hide yourself and write a gift of all my property to my son.&#8221; Both
gifts were annulled: to the woman &#8211; because it was given under duress,
to the son &#8211; because it was only for subterfuge.</span></body></html>
