a young dove was found within fifty amot (100 feet) of a dovecote, it
belongs to the owner of the dovecote; if farther than fifty amot &#8211; it
belongs to the one who found it. Rabbi Yirmiyah asked, &#8220;What if one of
its legs is within fifty amot but the other leg is outside of fifty?&#8221; -
and for asking this question the Sages ejected Rabbi Yirmiyah from the
house of study.</span><br>

<span style="font-size: medium;">One must distance a permanent granary
fifty amot from a city, and a temporary granary must be far enough from
his neighbor's saplings or from his plowed field, so that the chaff
that flies from the granary not cause them any damage.</span></body></html>
