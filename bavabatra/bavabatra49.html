relented and sold him what he demanded. Rabbah bar bar Chanah signed
two documents: notification that the sale was executed under duress, as
well as the document of sale<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
Said Rav Huna: both documents have legal force. But how can it be?
Rather, what Rav Huna meant is that the forced sale would be valid, if
not canceled by the prior notification &#8211; since it was Rav Huna who
introduced <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2009/10/bava-batra-48-is-forced-action-valid.html">the forced sale rule</a>.<br>
<br>
But we have a <a href="http://www.poetry-chaikhana.com/K/KhayyamOmar/51MovingFing.htm">rule that a witness, having testified, can't offer a new testimony contradicting his first one</a>.
How could Rabbah sign on both documents? - Exactly! Since he signed on
the notification of duress first, his signature on the document of sale
becomes invalid.</span></body></html>
