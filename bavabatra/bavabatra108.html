to the deceased inherits his possessions. The basic succession of heirs
is thus as follows: a man's primary heir is his son. If there is no
son, the estate reverts to the deceased man's daughter. After this the
next eligible heir is the father of the deceased, and if there is no
living father, the estate reverts to that father's own heirs.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

There are persons who can inherit and bequeath possessions, such as a
son, who can inherits from his father, but also bequeath to him. There
are also those persons who inherit but do not bequeath &#8211; such as a son
and his mother &#8211; he can inherit from her, but the mother does not
inherit from her son. <br>
