ownership, discussed so far, had a challenge against it. For example, a
case where a seller, that is, the previous owner claims &#8220;I did not sell
the land,&#8221; and the purchaser, that is, the occupant, claims, &#8220;I
purchased it&#8221; - this is the chazakah of proving title, which requires
three years to take effect.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
But regarding a chazakah against which there is no challenge, for
example, one who gives a gift, or two brothers who divide an estate &#8211;
where the purpose of chazakah is merely to acquire the property in
question &#8211; if one locked, fenced, or breached the property even to a
minor extent &#8211; this is considered chazakah.</span></body></html>
