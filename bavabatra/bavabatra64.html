fellow, neither the house's pit nor its cistern (dug into the ground
and used as water reservoirs) are included in the sale, even if the
seller wrote in the deed, &#8220;I am selling the depth and height of the
house.&#8221; <br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">

However, to get to the cistern, the seller has to purchase the
right-of-way from the buyer, in the opinion of Rabbi Akiva. According
to him, the typical inclination of one who sells something is to
transfer it in full and generous fashion, without reserving anything
for himself. In this case, by not saying anything, he transferred the
right-of-way also. The Sages disagree and say that typically the seller
wants to sell no more than he has to, retaining the right to pass
through the house to reach the cistern.</span></body></html>
