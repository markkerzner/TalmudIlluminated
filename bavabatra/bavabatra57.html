<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/Stqee74x10I/AAAAAAAACsw/TnNNTQKUl8I/s1600-h/Alexandre+Defaux+-+Feeding+the+Chickens.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hGn1v4stHxE/Stqee74x10I/AAAAAAAACsw/TnNNTQKUl8I/s320/Alexandre+Defaux+-+Feeding+the+Chickens.jpg" border="0"></a>These activities do not
establish chazakah: if a person would place an animal in a courtyard
belonging to someone else; if he would place an oven, millstones or a
stove in the courtyard; if he would raise chicken or deposit his manure
there. The property owner can claim that he saw no harm in allowing
these items to remain.<br></div><span style="font-size: medium;">
<br>
But if the user made a partition for his animals ten hand-breadths
high, or he erected such a partition for an oven, stove or millstone;
if he brought his chicken into the owner's house, or if he made for his
manure in the courtyard a place either three hand-breadths deep or
three hand-breadths high &#8211; this is a chazakah. If the owner did not
protest these uses of his property for three years, it supports the
user's claim that he acquired the right to use the purposes for those
purposes.</span></body></html>
