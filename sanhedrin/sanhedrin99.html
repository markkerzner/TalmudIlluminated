<span style="font-size: medium;">The Messianic Era
 may last for <a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/95-10.htm">40 years</a>, <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/23-15.htm">70 years</a>, <a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/15-13.htm">400 years</a>, or <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/63-4.htm">365,000 years</a> &#8211; God's year.<br>
<br>
The books of Prophets contain many descriptions of the utopian idyllic 
state of life. All these refer only to the Messianic Era, but the reward
 of the World to Come is beyond human comprehension, and &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/64-4.htm">No eye except Yours, O God, has 
seen that which He will do for one who awaits Him</a>&#8221; &#8211; this is the 
opinion of Rabbi Yochanan. However, Shmuel says that there will be no 
difference between this world and the Messianic Era, except that the 
Jews will be completely free from foreign dominion.<br>
<br>
What is the reward for constant Torah study? &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/16-26.htm">If a person toils in the study
 of Torah, the Torah will toil for him after death</a>&#8221; - asking God to 
keep giving him knowledge. <br>
<br>
Every <a href="http://bible.cc/job/5-7.htm">man is created for toil</a>,
 and it is <a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/16-26.htm">not physical 
labor but verbal toil</a>, and specifically the study of Torah, because 
of &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/joshua/1-8.htm">This Book of the Torah is 
not to leave your mouth</a>.&#8221; Therefore, happy is one who merits to toil
 in Torah.<br>
