<span style="font-size: medium;">After Noah went 
out of the Ark, he was given seven laws for the following generations: 
civil law to enforce the other six prohibitions, prohibitions of 
blasphemy, idolatry, sexual transgressions, murder, theft, and eating a 
limb torn from a live animal. For the violation of three transgressions a
 Noahide may be executed: for sexual transgressions, murder, and 
&#8220;blessing&#8221; the Divine Name. Some add idolatry to this list, and some say
 that for violation of any of the seven Noahide laws, a Noahite is 
executed.<br>
<br>
A Noahite is executed by one judge, on the basis of the testimony of one
 witness, and even though he violated the prohibition without having 
received prior warning, and a man who judges or testifies can even be a 
relative of the accused.<br>
