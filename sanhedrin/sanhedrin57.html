For the violation of three transgressions a Noahide may be executed: for sexual transgressions, murder, and "blessing" the Divine Name. Some add idolatry to this list, and some say that for violation of any of the seven Noahide laws, a Noahite is executed. <br/> <br/> A Noahite is executed by one judge, on the basis of the testimony of one witness, and even though he violated the prohibition without having received prior warning, and a man who judges or testifies can even be a relative of the accused. <br/> <br/> Art: Manfredi de Battilor Bartolo Di Fredi Fredi - Noah Building the Ark</body></html>
