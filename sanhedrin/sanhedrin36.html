<span style="font-size: medium;">A sanhedrin was 
seated in the shape of half a circular &#8220;threshing floor,&#8221; that is, in a 
semicircle, so that the judges could see each other. Two judicial 
scribes stand before them, one to the right and one to the left, and 
they would record the words of those arguing for conviction and the 
words of those arguing for acquittal. Both scribes record all words, so 
that if one errs, he can be corrected from the other scribe's notes.<br>
<br>
Three rows of disciples of the sages would sit before them, so that if 
the presiding judges would be deadlocked, more judges could be added 
from these disciples. The disciples sit in the order of eminence. If the
 judges needed to ordain someone, they would ordain one of the disciples
 from the first row. One disciple from the second row would move to the 
first, one disciple from the third row would move to the second, and one
 more person from the scholarly community would be put in the third row.<br>
