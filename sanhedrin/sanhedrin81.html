<span style="font-size: medium;">One who became 
liable to two types of execution by the court is subject to the more 
severe type. <br>
<br>
One who has been flogged twice by the court &#8211; the court places him in a 
cell and there they feed him barley until his stomach bursts. How could 
that be? Here we are dealing with one who repeated the same 
transgression twice, provided that this transgression carries the 
penalty of excision from Heaven. Since he demonstrated that he wants to 
die, the court just speeds up his death. However, if he transgressed 
multiple prohibitions, but each of them only once &#8211; he is just tasting 
various prohibitions.<br>
<br>
One who killed another but not in the presence of witnesses &#8211; that is, 
they gave him a warning, but he just nodded his head instead of verbal 
reply, or a similar technical disqualification &#8211; the court places him in
 a cell and feeds him scant bread and water until he dies. <br>
<br>
Complete cell procedure: they put him in a cell the size of his body, 
then feed him scant amounts until his stomach shrinks, then feed him 
abundant barley until his stomach bursts.<br>
