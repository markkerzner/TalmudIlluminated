<span style="font-size: medium;">Three kings have 
no share in the World to Come: Yarovam, Ahab, and Menasheh. <br>
<br>
The arrogance of Yarovam was the cause of his downfall, despite his 
initial greatness in Torah learning. As a king who was not a descendant 
of David, Yarovam would have to stand in the Temple Courtyard, while the
 king who was a true descendant would sit. Yarovam preferred to stop his
 subjects from pilgrimages to Jerusalem, and established two golden 
calves for worship instead. Any time a punishment comes to the nation of
 Israel, it contains a small measure of the punishment for the first 
Golden Calf; after Yarovam, there were two more.<br>
<br>
Rav Ashi ended his lecture on the three kings with &#8220;Tomorrow we will 
continue with our colleagues.&#8221; Menasheh came to him in a dream and 
asked, &#8220;You call us colleagues? Which place on the bread do you bless?&#8221; 
Rav Ashi did not know. &#8220;The one that is baked first,&#8221; - said Menasheh. 
&#8220;Then why did you worship idols?&#8221; - asked Rav Ashi. &#8220;If you were in our 
generation, you would run to worship them yourself,&#8221; said Menasheh. In 
the morning, Rav Ashi started with &#8220;Let us return to the three kings, 
our teachers.&#8221;<br>
