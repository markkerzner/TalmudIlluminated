<span style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Eliezer 
took ill, and four Sages came to visit him. The three Sages praised him,
 but Rabbi Akiva told him, &#8220;Precious are sufferings, for they effect 
atonement for you.&#8221; Said Rabbi Eliezer, &#8220;Support me, and I will hear the
 words of Rabbi Akiva, my student. From where do you derive this 
opinion?&#8221;<br>
<br>
Rabbi Akiva derived it from a verse. &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/2_kings/21-1.htm%20">Menasheh was twelve years old
 when he became king, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem... 
and he did evil in the eyes of God</a>.&#8221; <br>
<br>
Now Chizkiah his father taught Torah to the entire world. Of course, he 
taught his son Menasheh too. Nevertheless, with all the trouble that 
Chizkiah took with Menasheh to teach him the path of righteousness, in 
the end it was sufferings that elevated Menasheh to proper conduct: "<a href="http://bible.cc/2_chronicles/33-10.htm">God brought upon the 
people the king of Assyria, and they captured Menasheh with hooks and 
transported him to Babylon. When Menasheh was in distress, he humbled 
himself greatly before the God of his father, and God returned him to 
Jerusalem</a>". <br>
