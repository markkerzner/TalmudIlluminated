He has to know it from before and then take the risk in his own hands. Furthermore, he can only do it while the sinner is engaged in his sin. If the sinner stops, and the zealot kills him then, the zealot is responsible for murder. <br/> <br/> If a Kohen serves in the Temple in the state of ritual impurity, young Kohanim remove him outside the Courtyard and split open his skull with clubs. <br/> <br/> Art: Paul Cezanne - Vessels Fruit And Cloth In Front Of A Chest <br/></body></html>
