<span style="font-size: medium;">Caesar said to 
Rabbi Tanchum, &#8220;Come, let us become one nation.&#8221; Rabbi Tanchum replied, 
&#8220;Fine! However, we, who are circumcised, cannot become like you. You 
therefore circumcise yourself and become like us.&#8221; Caesar said, &#8220;You 
argued well. But whoever bests the king must be thrown into the pen of 
wild beasts.&#8221; They threw Rabbi Tanchum into the pen, but the beasts did 
not eat him. A certain Sadducee said to Caesar, &#8220;The reason the beasts 
did not eat him is that they are not hungry.&#8221; They threw the Sadducee to
 the beasts, and they ate him.<br>

A certain heretic said to Rabbi Avina, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/2_samuel/7-23.htm">Who is like Your people, 
Israel, one nation in the land...</a>?&#8221; But what is unique about them, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/40-17.htm">All the nations are like 
nothing before Him...</a>&#8221;  - and you are included! Rabbi Avina 
answered, &#8220;Your prophet, Bilaam, has  testified about us, ...<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/23-9.htm">And among nations you are not 
counted</a>.&#8221;<br>
