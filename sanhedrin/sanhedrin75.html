<span style="font-size: medium;">The following 
transgressions carry the penalty of burning. &#8220;Burning&#8221; does not mean 
that the convict is set on fire, but rather that molten lead is poured 
down his throat.<br>
<br>
One who cohabits with a woman and her daughter, and the married daughter
 of a Kohen who commits adultery &#8211; however, the man who committed 
adultery with her is strangled, like all other adulterers. Similar to 
the category of a woman and her daughter, one is burned for cohabiting 
with his daughter, his daughter's daughter and his son's daughter, his 
wife's daughter, her daughter's daughter and her son's daughter; his 
mother-in-law, his mother-in-law's mother and his father-in-law's 
mother.<br>
