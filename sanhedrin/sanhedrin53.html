<span style="font-size: medium;">Following is the 
procedure for those who are strangled: they would submerge him in manure
 up to his knees, to prevent jumping and to shorten the agony. They 
would place a hard scarf inside a soft one and wind it around his neck. 
One witness pulls toward himself and the other witness pulls to himself,
 until his souls departs.<br>
<br>
The following are executed by stoning: one who cohabits with his mother,
 or with his father's wife, or with his daughter-in-law, or with a male,
 or with an animal, or a woman who brings an animal upon herself, a 
blasphemer, one who serves idols, one who desecrates the Sabbath, one 
who curses his mother or father using the Name of God, one who cohabits 
with a betrothed young girl, a subverter of an entire city, a sorcerer, 
and a wayward and rebellious son.<br>
