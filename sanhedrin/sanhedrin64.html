<span style="font-size: medium;">Said Rav Yehudah 
in the name of Rav, &#8220;The Jews knew that there is no substance to 
idolatry, and they engaged in it only to permit for themselves overt 
immorality.&#8221; However, after they became attached to it, they longed for 
it like one longs for his son.<br>

Elijah the Righteous would seek out those bloated from hunger in 
Jerusalem, during the time of the first destruction. He found a child, 
bloated, in a heap trash. The child was the last from a large family. 
Elijah asked, &#8220;If I teach you something by which you will merit to live,
 will you learn it?&#8221; The child replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Elijah said to him, &#8220;Say,
 every day, Hear, O Israel, God our Lord, God is One.&#8221; The child said, 
&#8220;Be silent, do not mention the name of God which my father and mother 
had not taught.&#8221; He then brought out the statue of his deity from his 
bosom, and embraced it and kissed it until his abdomen burst. He fell on
 his deity to fulfill, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/26-30.htm%20">I
 will cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols</a>.&#8221;<br>
<br>
In the time of the Second Temple the Sages prayed and fasted for three 
days to eliminate the power of the Evil Urge for idol worship. It 
appeared as a fiery lion cub out of the Holy of Holies. They threw it 
into a lead cauldron and covered it with lead. They then tied the Evil 
Urge for immorality for three days, but could not even find a fresh egg 
when they needed it. Since they could not eliminate the urge for only 
the prohibited, they at least removed the desire for relatives, like 
one's mother and sister.<br>
