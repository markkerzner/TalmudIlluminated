cases cover most areas of civil dispute. Such cases are judged by
courts of three qualified judges. Judges act on the basis of the
testimony given by two qualified witnesses. There is no concept of a
jury, and in general no concept of circumstantial evidence.<br>
<br>
Cases of robbery and bodily injury are also monetary cases, adjudicated
by courts of three qualified judges. Qualified in this context means
that in addition to knowing the areas of relevant Torah law and
relevant scientific discovery, they must also possess &#8220;semicha,&#8221; an
uninterrupted chain of ordination going back to Moses.<br>
<br>
However, cases of loans can be adjudicated even by judges without
semicha. This was an additional enactment made in order "not to close
doors for the would-be borrowers," so that lenders would find it easy
to resolve loan questions, and wouldn't always require ordained judges
in cases of loan disputes.<br>
