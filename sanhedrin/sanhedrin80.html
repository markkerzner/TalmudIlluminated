<span style="font-size: medium;">If a murderer 
became intermingled with others, they are all exempt from capital 
punishment. Rabbi Yehudah says, &#8220;We place them in a cell where they are 
fed barley until their stomachs burst.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Who are these others? One explanation is that a murderer whose verdict 
has not been finalized &#8211; even though the judges have voted for guilty 
sentence -  got mixed with other murderers, whose verdicts have been 
finalized. Since the verdict has to be announced in his presence, and 
they don't know who he is, and since moreover, they have to say to him, 
&#8220;So-and-so, you are liable&#8221; and again they can't &#8211; he is free, and with 
him all the other murderers. Rabbi Yehudah holds that since after all 
they are murderers and cannot be executed only because of a 
technicality, the court causes their deaths indirectly.<br>
