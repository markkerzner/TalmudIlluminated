<span style="font-size: medium;">One who strikes 
his father or mother is not liable to execution unless he wounds them. 
Cursing a parent is more stringent than striking him, since one who 
curses his parent after the parent's death is liable to execution, but 
one who strikes his parent after the parent's death is exempt.<br>
<br>
One is liable for cursing a parent only if the parent is &#8220;among your 
people,&#8221; that is, doing the deeds of your people &#8211; observing the Torah. 
One is liable for striking even a non-observant parent.<br>
<br>
One who kidnaps a Jew is not liable to strangulation unless he takes him
 into his possession, works him, and sells him. If one kidnaps his own 
son, then Rabbi Ishmael makes him liable, but the Sages exempt him. If 
one kidnapped someone who was half slave and half freeman, Rabbi Yehudah
 renders him liable, but the Sages exempt him.<br>
