<span style="font-size: medium;">Monetary cases 
may be concluded on the same day as they have started, however capital 
cases may be concluded on the same day for acquittal, but only on the 
following day for conviction. The judges go home at night and consider 
the matter further, trying to find more reasons for acquittal. <br>
<br>
Because of that, capital cases may not be tried on Friday. If the 
verdict is for conviction, the man has to be executed on Saturday, and 
that is not possible. Waiting with the execution is not allowed, so as 
not to prolong the agony. Concluding the judgment on Sunday is also not 
possible, because the judges may forget the arguments. And even though 
scribes write down their arguments, they don't write down their 
thoughts.<br>
