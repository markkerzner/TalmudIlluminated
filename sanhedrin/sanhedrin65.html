<span style="font-size: medium;">One who gives of 
his offspring to Molech is not liable to stoning unless he hands the 
child over to Molech and passes him through the fire. The child would 
remain alive, being either passed between two walls of fire, or the 
parent would jump with him over a fiery pit. There were other forms of 
worship, though, where the child was actually burned.<br>
<br>
A practitioner of Ov is a necromancer  - one who communicates with the 
dead &#8211; by raising the spirit of the deceased from the ground and causing
 it to take up residence under his armpits, from where its voice 
emanates. A practitioner of Yidoni takes a bone of the animal known as 
Yadua and places it in his mouth, from where a voice then emanates. 
These are both liable to stoning, and one who inquires of them violates a
 negative commandment.<br>
