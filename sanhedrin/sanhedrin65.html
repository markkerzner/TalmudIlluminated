The child would remain alive, being either passed between two walls of fire, or the parent would jump with him over a fiery pit. There were other forms of worship, though, where the child was actually burned. <br/> <br/> A practitioner of Ov is a necromancer - one who communicates with the dead - by raising the spirit of the deceased from the ground and causing it to take up residence under his armpits, from where its voice emanates. A practitioner of Yidoni takes a bone of the animal known as Yadua and places it in his mouth, from where a voice then emanates. These are both liable to stoning, and one who inquires of them violates a negative commandment. <br/> <br/> Art: Aleksei Ivanovich Korzukhin - The Wake at the Cemetery</body></html>
