<span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">He shall not multiply wives</a>...&#8221;
 - only up to eighteen - &#8220;... <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">so that his heart is not 
turned away</a>.&#8221;&nbsp; Rabbi Yehudah says, &#8220;He may multiply wives beyond 
eighteen, provided that they do not turn his heart away from God.&#8221; Rabbi
 Shimon says, &#8220;Even if one can turn his heart away, he may not marry 
her.&#8221;<br>
<br>
The king may, however, have concubines. Tamar was David's daughter from a
 beautiful concubine captured in war. Amnon violated her and&nbsp; &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/2_samuel/13-15.htm">hated her with a very great 
hatred</a>...&#8221; Why? Because she entangled her pubic hair around&nbsp; <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/23-1.htm">his member and cut it</a>. 
But Jewish women were renowned for not having pubic hair!? - Tamar was 
different.<br>
<br>
&#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">The king may not 
multiply horses</a>...&#8221; - only enough for his chariots. &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">And silver and gold he 
shall not accumulate overmuch</a>&#8221; &#8211; only enough to pay his soldier's 
wages.<br>
<br>
He writes a personal Torah scroll for himself and carries it with him at
 all times.<br>
