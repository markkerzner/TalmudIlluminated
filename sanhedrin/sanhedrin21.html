Rabbi Shimon says, "Even if one can turn his heart away, he may not marry her." <br/> <br/> The king may, however, have concubines. Tamar was David's daughter from a beautiful concubine captured in war. Amnon violated her and  "... <a href = "http://bible.cc/2_samuel/13-15.htm">hated her with a very great hatred</a> ..." Why? Because she entangled her pubic hair around  <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/23-1.htm">his member and cut it</a> . But Jewish women were renowned for not having pubic hair!? - Tamar was different. <br/> <br/> " <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-16.htm">The king may not multiply horses</a> ..." - only enough for his chariots. " <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">And silver and gold he shall not accumulate overmuch</a> " - only enough to pay his soldier's wages. <br/> <br/> He writes a personal Torah scroll for himself and carries it with him at all times. <br/> <br/> Art: Juan Gimenez y Martin - The Harem <br/> <br/></body></html>
