<span style="font-size: medium;">Four different 
methods of execution were used by the court, depending on the various 
capital offenses that the person has committed. In descending order of 
severity these are: stoning, burning, beheading, and strangulation. <br>
<br>
What difference does the severity of the execution make? In a situation 
where one has committed several capital offenses, each of which renders 
him liable to a different type of execution &#8211; since one cannot be 
executed more than once - he receives the more severe type of execution 
for which he is liable. Rabbi Shimon lists them in a different order: 
burning, stoning, strangulation, and beheading.<br>
