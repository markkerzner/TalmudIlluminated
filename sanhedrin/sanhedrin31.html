<span style="font-size: medium;">In general, there
 is no statute of limitations on the submission of evidence. Even after 
the verdict has been issued, whenever a litigant brings evidence to 
support his claim, he can nullify the verdict.<br>
<br>
If the judges found it necessary to impose a time limit and told the 
litigant, after issuing a verdict against him, &#8220;All evidence that you 
may have to support your claim, you must produce within the next thirty 
days,&#8221; then the rule is: if he finds evidence within thirty days, he can
 nullify the verdict, but if he finds it after thirty days, he cannot 
nullify the verdict.<br>
<br>
Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, &#8220;What should this person do? Rather, he 
may present the evidence even after thirty days.&#8221; The law follows Rabban
 Shimon ben Gamliel.<br>
<br>
If a litigant saw that he was about to be found liable and then produced
 witnesses, he is not believed, because it is a desperate attempt to win
 the case.<br>
