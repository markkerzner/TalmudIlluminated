Even after the verdict has been issued, whenever a litigant brings evidence to support his claim, he can nullify the verdict. <br/> <br/> If the judges found it necessary to impose a time limit and told the litigant, after issuing a verdict against him, "All evidence that you may have to support your claim, you must produce within the next thirty days," then the rule is: if he finds evidence within thirty days, he can nullify the verdict, but if he finds it after thirty days, he cannot nullify the verdict. <br/> <br/> Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says, "What should this person do? Rather, he may present the evidence even after thirty days." The law follows Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel. <br/> <br/> If a litigant saw that he was about to be found liable and then produced witnesses, he is not believed, because it is a desperate attempt to win the case. <br/> <br/> Art: Jan Cornelisz Vermeyen - Portrait of Judge John More</body></html>
