<span style="font-size: medium;">Said Rabbi Abba, -
 There is no clearer indication of the &#8220;End&#8221; than this: &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/ezekiel/36-8.htm">But you, O mountains of Israel, 
you shall shoot forth your branches and bear your fruit for My people 
Israel</a>...&#8221;, that is, the Land of Israel will yield fruit in 
abundance shortly before the redemption.<br>
<br>
In the generation of the Messiah, there will be denunciation among the 
Torah scholars.<br>
<br>
The Messiah will come to the generation that is completely virtuous or 
completely sinful. If a person is somewhat virtuous, he is unlikely to 
repent, because he focuses on his good attributes.  On the other hand, 
one who completely lacks virtue has no grounds for self-deception and 
thus is open to the realization that he must repent and merit God's 
redemption.<br>
<br>
The coming of the Messiah will be preceded by multiple troubles and 
tribulations. Ulla said, &#8220;May he come, but may I not see him,&#8221; but Rav 
Yosef said, &#8220;May he come, and may I merit to sit in the shadow of his 
donkey's dung!&#8221;<br>
