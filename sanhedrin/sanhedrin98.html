If a person is somewhat virtuous, he is unlikely to repent, because he focuses on his good attributes. On the other hand, one who completely lacks virtue has no grounds for self-deception and thus is open to the realization that he must repent and merit God's redemption. <br/> <br/> The coming of the Messiah will be preceded by multiple troubles and tribulations. Ulla said, "May he come, but may I not see him," but Rav Yosef said, "May he come, and may I merit to sit in the shadow of his donkey's dung!" <br/> <br/> Art: Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot - The Donkey <br/></body></html>
