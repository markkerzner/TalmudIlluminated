<span style="font-size: medium;">They would 
examine the witnesses with seven questions related to time and place of 
the incident: which seven year-period did you see the crime, which year,
 which month, which day of the month, which day of the week, which hour,
 and in which place. The primary purpose of these questions is to 
pinpoint the time and place, and allow the possibility of making them <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-27-from-what-time-is-refuted.html">disqualified
 (false) witnesses</a>. In fact, if there is no possibility for the 
witnesses to be disqualified, their testimony is not accepted.<br>
<br>
Then they they would ask specific questions: &#8220;Did you recognize the 
victim?&#8221; and &#8220;Did you warn the accused?&#8221; In cases of idol worship, they 
asked &#8220;What idol did he worship and how did he worship it?&#8221; Whoever 
increases the number of supplementary questions is praiseworthy. It once
 happened that Ben Zakkai examined the witnesses concerning the stems of
 the figs on the fig tree under which the murder allegedly occurred.<br>
