<span style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Eliezer 
once taught Rabbi Akiba the act of magic with cucumbers: by saying a few
 words, he had planted a field full of cucumbers, and by saying a few 
other words he made them collect into one place. How was he allowed to 
practice witchcraft, if it says, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">You shall not learn to do it</a>&#8221;?
 &#8211; Because you can learn in order to understand and teach.<br>
<br>
However, that was the only piece of knowledge that Rabbi Akiba learned 
from him after Rabbi Eliezer was excommunicated for not following the 
law accepted by the majority. When Rabbi Eliezer was dying, he predicted
 that the Sages who did not realize their full learning potential 
because of not learning from him would die a martyr's death, and it came
 true.<br>
<br>
A wayward and rebellious son is a boy who commits certain sins 
associated with theft and gluttony. If his parents admonish him and he 
ignores their warnings, he is flogged in court. If he still persists in 
his behavior, he is put to death through stoning.<br>
