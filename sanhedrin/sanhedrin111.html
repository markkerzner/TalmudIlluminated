<span style="font-size: medium;">The Ten Tribes 
are not destined to ever return from their place of exile, because God &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/29-28.htm">cast them to another land,
 as this very day</a>.&#8221; Just as the day goes, never to return, so the 
Ten Tribes go, never to return &#8211; these are the words of Rabbi Akiva. 
Rabbi Eliezer, however, says that the phrase &#8220;as this very day&#8221;  implies
 that just as the day darkens and then becomes light, so too the Ten 
Tribes, for whom it is dark, will likewise one day have light. Said 
Rabbi Yochanan, &#8220;Rabbi Akiva has abandoned his usual generosity of 
spirit.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Isaiah said, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/5-14.htm">Therefore Sheol 
(another name for Gehinnom) has expanded her desire and opened wide her 
mouth without measure.</a>&#8221; Resh Lakish explained &#8220;without measure&#8221; as 
saying that whoever leaves even a single law unfulfilled is condemned to
 punishment in Gehinnom. Rabbi Yochanan said to him, &#8220;God, the Master, 
is not pleased with you saying such things about his subjects.&#8221; Rather, 
if one learned no more than a single law, he will be spared the 
punishment of Sheol.<br>
