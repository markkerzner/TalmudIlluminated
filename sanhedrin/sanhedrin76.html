<span style="font-size: medium;">The following 
transgressors face the penalty of beheading: a murderer, and people of a
 subverted city, who were led astray and worshipped a false god.<br>
<br>
If a murderer struck his fellow with a stone or with a piece of iron, or
 if he held him in water or fire and the victim could not escape and 
died, the murderer is liable to execution. But if the murderer pushed 
him into water or into fire and he was able to escape, but he died 
anyway, the murderer is not liable to execution. If he incited a dog or a
 snake to bite a man, and a dog or a snake bit him and he died, the 
murderer is not liable to execution. Since he did not murder the victim 
directly, he cannot be executed by a human court.<br>
<br>
If someone took the snake in his hand and held its fangs to the victim's
 flesh, Rabbi Yehudah rules that he is liable to the death penalty, but 
the Sages exempt him.<br>
