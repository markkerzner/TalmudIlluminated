Refuted false witnesses get the same punishment as what they wanted to inflict on the one about whom they testified. <br/> <br/> If witnesses testified in January, but later were exposed as false witnesses in July, then what happens to their unrelated testimony given in <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin27.html"><a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin27.html">M</a></a>arch? <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin27.html"><a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin27.html">A</a></a>baye says that they are disqualified retroactively, since <a href = "null">they are evildoers</a> . Rava says that the law of false witnesses is such a novelty that it cannot be analyzed logically; they are false only from now on, and their March testimony is unaffected. <br/> <br/> This is the "A" in the six cases abbreviated <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-metzia/bava-metzia21.html"><a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/bava-metzia/bava-metzia21.html">Y</a></a> A <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/eruvin/eruvin15.html"><a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/eruvin/eruvin15.html">L</a></a> <a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/kiddushin/kiddushin51.html"><a href = "http://talmudilluminated.com/kiddushin/kiddushin51.html">K</a></a> G M where the law follows Abaye against Rava. <br/> <br/> If a witness eats non-kosher meat because it is cheaper, then he cannot testify, because he can be bribed. What if he eats it to make a point? Abaye says that he is an evildover, thus disqualified. Rava says that for disqualification he needs to be an evildoer in matters of money, not ritual. <br/> <br/> And this is the "M" in the six cases abbreviated  Y   A   L   K  G  M  where the law follows Abaye against Rava. <br/> <br/> Art: Thomas Sully - Gossip</body></html>
