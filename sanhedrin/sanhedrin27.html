<span style="font-size: medium;">Witnesses can be 
refuted and become false witnesses in the following way: a second set of
 witnesses comes and testifies that the first witnesses could not have 
possibly seen the incident to which they testified, since they were with
 them (the second set) in a different place at that very time. Refuted 
false witnesses get the same punishment as what they wanted to inflict 
on the one about whom they testified.<br>
<br>
If witnesses testified in January, but later were exposed as false 
witnesses in July, then what happens to their unrelated testimony given 
in March?&nbsp;Abaye says that they are disqualified retroactively, since <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/23-1.htm">they are evildoers</a>. Rava says
 that the law of false witnesses is such a novelty that it cannot be 
analyzed logically; they are false only from now on, and their March 
testimony is unaffected.<br>

If a witness eats non-kosher meat because it is cheaper, then he cannot 
testify, because he can be bribed. What if he eats it to make a point? 
Abaye says that he is an evildover, thus disqualified. Rava says that 
for disqualification he needs to be an evildoer in matters of money, not
 ritual.<br>
