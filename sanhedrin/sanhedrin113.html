<span style="font-size: medium;">Holy Scriptures, 
found in the subverted city, are to be buried. However, Rabbi Eliezer 
says that they should have been burned together with other property, and
 since this is not allowed,  any city that has at least one mezuzah 
cannot be judged as subverted city.<br>
<br>
Yehoshua said, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/joshua/6-26.htm%20">Cursed be 
the man before Hashem, who rises up and builds this city, Jericho. With 
his oldest son he will lay its foundation and with his youngest son he 
will set up its gates</a>.&#8221; Chiel, a close friend of King Ahab, rebuilt 
the city, and the curse was fulfilled in him. Elijah came to console 
him, and Ahab asked if he thought the curse of Joshua was the cause. 
Ellijah confirmed. Then Ahab said that Moses had cursed everybody who 
worhsips idols with drought, and that he has established an idol on 
every hill, but in Israel there was an abundance of rain.<br>
<br>
Elijah immediately decreed a drought, and God granted it to him. Elijah 
had to run away to the desert, where ravens brought him bread and meat, 
and he drank from a brook. Eventually the brook dried out, and Elijah 
was commanded to go live in Tsarfat. When the son of his hostess died, 
Elijah wanted to revive him, but God said, &#8220;I have three keys &#8211; from 
childbirth, rain, and resurrection. It is not proper for Me to have one,
 and for you &#8211; two. Elijah had to give up the key to rain, and drought 
ended.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Yose called Elijah an irascible person. Elijah hid from him for 
three days. When Ellijah came, Rabbi Yose asked, &#8220;why were you hiding?&#8221; 
Elijah answered - &#8220;You called me irascible!&#8221; Rabbi Yose said, &#8220;So you 
are irascible again!&#8221;<br>
