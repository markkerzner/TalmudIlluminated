<span style="font-size: medium;">The rebellious 
sage is executed by the High Court in Jerusalem, at the time of the next
 Festival, so that &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-13.htm">the 
entire nation shall hear and fear and will not act willfully anymore</a>&#8221;
  - these are the words of Rabbi Akiva. However, Rabbi Yehudah says that
 they do not delay the judgment, but rather execute him immediately, and
 then write out proclamations and send messengers to all places.<br>
<br>
A false prophet is executed at the hands of man, but one who suppresses 
his prophecy, one who disregards the word of a prophet, or a prophet who
 transgresses his own words is subject to death at the hands of Heaven. <br>
