<span style="font-size: medium;">Rav Hamnuna lost 
several oxen and went to search for them. Rabbah met him and asked a 
question: we have learned that <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/04/sanhedrin-60-idol-worship-liability.html">one
 who serves an idol is subject to stoning</a>. This implies that one has
 to actually serve the idol to be liable. But in regard to a subverted 
city, we have learned that if one says, &#8220;I will serve,&#8221; or &#8220;I will go 
and serve,&#8221; or &#8220;Let us go and serve&#8221; a certain idol, he is already 
liable. So is action required or is professed intention sufficient?<br>
<br>
Rav Hamnuna replied, &#8220;In the first case he does not accept the idol as 
deity until he serves it. In the second case, however, his statement 
implies that he accepts the idol as his deity as of now &#8211; and he will 
shortly serve it. Thus, he is liable for something else - for accepting 
the idol as a deity&#8221; - precisely <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/04/sanhedrin-60-idol-worship-liability.html">as
 we have learned</a>.</span><br>

The Talmud does not say what happened to the oxen.<br>
