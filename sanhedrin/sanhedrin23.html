<span style="font-size: medium;">Monetary cases 
are judged by a court of three judges. This includes cases of disputed 
loans, theft, bodily injury, and monetary damage. <br>
<br>
If the defendant is unwilling to come to trial, any court of three can 
impose its authority. Moreover, if the defendant resides in a city that 
has an established official court, he cannot choose a new court for 
judgment. However, if he is willing to be judged but does not agree to 
the suggested court because it is either too far or is not qualified, 
they can use the following procedure:<br>
<br>
One litigant selects a judge, the other litigant selects a judge, and 
both litigants together select one more judge &#8211; these are the words of 
Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say: &#8220;The two judges selected by the litigants
 select a third one.&#8221; The judge selected by each litigant will make sure
 that his position is clearly represented.<br>
