<span style="font-size: medium;">After the High 
Court has decided in opposition to the ruling of the rebellious sage, 
and the sage has returned to his town and taught and interpreted in the 
manner he was used to before being instructed otherwise by the High 
Court, he is not yet liable; but if he instructed people to act in 
accordance with his overruled opinion, he is liable to the death penalty
 as a rebellious sage, as it is stated, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">but the man who will act 
with willfulness</a>.&#8221;<br>
<br>
A disciple who instructed people to act in accordance with his opinion 
that was overruled by the High Court is not liable &#8211; and it emerges that
 his stringency (no authority to decide the questions of law) is his 
leniency (not being liable as a rebellious sage).<br>
