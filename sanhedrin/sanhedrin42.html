<span style="font-size: medium;">Once a verdict 
has been reached and the defendant is pronounced guilty, they take him 
out to stone him. The stoning place was located outside the courthouse. A
 court that sentences even one person in seven years is called 
&#8220;destroyer,&#8221; and it would have been aggravated if the execution happened
 nearby.<br>
<br>
While the condemned is being escorted to the execution grounds, one man 
stands at the courthouse door with a flag in his hand, and another sits 
astride a horse at a distance. If someone says, &#8220;I have grounds to argue
 for his acquittal,&#8221; the flagman waves the flags and the horse with its 
rider races to the execution party and halts it. Even if the condemned 
himself says, &#8220;I have grounds for my own acquittal,&#8221; they return him to 
the courthouse to hear his arguments, even four or five times, as long 
as there is substance to his words.<br>
