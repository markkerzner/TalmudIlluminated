<span style="font-size: medium;">The real reason 
why Rabbi Yehudah the Prince requires five judges is because in &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-9.htm">whomever the judges condemn</a>...&#8221;
 the word &#8220;condemn,&#8221; &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1497;&#1506;&#1503; is plural, which means two judges. Another 
two judges are mentioned below, and since the court needs an odd number 
of judges to be able to rule by majority, the total is five.<br>
<br>
The Sages, however, say that since the word &#8220;condemn&#8221; &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1497;&#1506;&#1503; is written 
defectively, without an usual letter vav &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1503; that one would expect 
for plural, it means one judge. Therefore, their count is three judges.<br>
<br>
The basic argument here is whether the pronounced form of the word 
(Rabbi Yehudah) or its written form (Sages) is more important. Other 
arguments hinging on the same &#8220;written or pronounced&#8221; premise include 
the number of blood applications of a sacrifice needed for atonement, 
the number of walls in a sukkah, and the amount of blood from two 
corpses that creates ritual impurity.<br>
