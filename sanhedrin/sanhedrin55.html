<span style="font-size: medium;">Rav Achadboi bar 
Ami inquired of Rav Sheshet, &#8220;One who commits the initial stage of 
copulation with himself, what is the law?&#8221; In other words, if one bends 
his organ underneath himself until it touches his orifice, is he liable 
for sodomy? Rav Sheshet answered him, "You upset us with impossible 
questions!"<br>
<br>
In discussing this, Rav Ashi said to Ravina, &#8220;What point is in question 
to you?&#8221; You should be able to resolve the inquiry on your own, as 
follows. In a state of erection, you cannot find such case. Therefore, 
you can only find such case when the organ is limp. According to the 
view which says that one who copulates with women forbidden to whom when
 his organ is limp is not liable, here too, he is not liable. On the 
view that one IS liable for such copulation in the case of a forbidden 
woman, here too, he is obviously liable to two sin offerings: one for 
committing the copulative act, and one for submitting to copulative act.<br>
