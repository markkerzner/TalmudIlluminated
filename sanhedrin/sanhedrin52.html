<span style="font-size: medium;">The following is 
the procedure for those who are burned. They would place a hard scarf 
inside a soft one and wind it around his neck. One witness pulls toward 
himself, the other one pulls toward himself, until the executed opens 
his mouth, and then they pore molten lead inside. The lead descends into
 his stomach and burns his intestines.<br>
<br>
This procedure is for those who are beheaded: they would decapitate him 
with the sword, cutting off his head from the front. Said Rabbi Yehudah,
 &#8220;It is a disgrace for him, since the Roman government does the same. 
Rather, they chop it off with an ax.&#8221; Answered the Sages, &#8220;That would be
 even more disgraceful.&#8221;<br>
<br>
But how do we know to cut off the head, and not, say, stab him? - 
Because it says, &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/13-15.htm">by 
the edge of the sword</a>...&#8221; Then let's cut him in half!? - Said Rab 
Nachman, &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/19-18.htm">And you shall
 love your fellow as yourself</a>...&#8221; means to choose a favorable death 
for him.<br>
