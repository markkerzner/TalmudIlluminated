<span style="font-size: medium;">In the generation
 when the son of David (Mashiach) will come, the meeting place of the 
scholars will be used for licentiousness, the wisdom of the scholars 
will decay, those who fear sin will be despised, and the face of the 
generation will be like the face of a dog. The truth will be absent, as 
in &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/59-15.htm">And the truth will be 
absent, and he that turns away from evil will become foolish</a>.&#8221; <br>
<br>
Rabbi Meir Abulafia  (c. 1170 &#8211; 1244, Burgos, Spain) in his book &#8220;Yad 
Ramah&#8221; remarks: &#8220;I am in wonderment! According to these signs, why has 
the son of David not come in this generation of ours?&#8221;<br>
<br>
But how can we say that the truth will be absent, when there is a 
promise that the Jewish people will never be devoid of Torah scholars, 
who are devoted to truth?  - Truth will be divided into many small 
groups, each with its own truth, so that it will be very hard to find.<br>
<br>
The world is destined to exist for six thousand years; the first two 
thousand were of nothingness, without the Torah, the second two thousand
 were of Torah, and the the third two thousand are the days of the 
Messiah. <a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/file-download/the-age-of-the-universe---a-torah-true-perspective/3097384">This,
 however, is only talking about the last 7-year cycle, in which we find 
ourselves, but according to one estimate in Kabbalah, we are at the end 
of sixth Shmitah, at  42,000 years divine years, which translates into 
15 billion human years</a>.<br>
<br>
There are many calculations of the end of the world, and most of them 
have already passed. <br>
