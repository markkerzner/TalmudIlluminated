<span style="font-size: medium;">Balaam gave the 
following advice to the Moabites, &#8220;The God of these (Jews) hates 
immorality. Furthermore, I know that they have a penchant for linen 
garments they used to have in Egypt. Therefore, set tents and place 
harlots in them, an older one outside and a younger one inside.&#8221;<br>
<br>
When the Jews would eat and drink and be merry and go out shopping, the 
older harlot would say to  them, &#8220;I have linen garments outside and even
 better and cheaper ones inside.&#8221; After a few visits, the younger harlot
 would tell him, &#8220;You are like a member of the family. Choose from our 
merchandise for yourself, and have a glass of Ammonite wine (same as 
used by the daughters of Lot).&#8221; Once he drank, passion would burn in 
him, and he would say to her, &#8220;Yield yourself to me!&#8221; She would produce 
an idol from her bosom and tell him, &#8220;Worship this!&#8221; If he refused, she 
said, &#8220;All we ask is that you defecate in front of him.&#8221; The Jew would 
do it, not knowing that this was the normal manner of worship.<br>
<br>
The learning of Doeg was so great that he knew all the cases of the 
added and deleted letters in the Torah, all the logic in the Torah, and 
three hundred laws about a tower which floats in the air. The reason for
 his downfall was his envy, which led him to malign King David.<br>
