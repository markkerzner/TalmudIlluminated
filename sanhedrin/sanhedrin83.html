<span style="font-size: medium;">Rav Acha bur Huna
 inquired of Rav Sheshet, &#8220;If a Kohen served in the Temple in a state of
 spiritual impurity, is he liable to death at the hands  of Heaven?&#8221;<br>
<br>
Said Rav Sheshet, &#8220;You answer is in <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/05/sanhedrin-82-extrajudicial-executions.html">the
 previous ruling</a>: young Kohanim remove him outside the Courtyard and
 split open his skull with clubs. If he is liable at the hands of 
Heaven, simply leave him to die at the hands of Heaven!&#8221; Answered Rav 
Acha, &#8220;But could it be that he is not liable at the hands of Heaven, and
 yet we we kill him?&#8221; The final rule is that the Kohen is indeed liable 
to death at the hands of Heaven, but only if he performed a concluding 
service.<br>
<br>
The following are liable to death at the hands of Heaven: one who eats 
produce before tithe separation, a non-Kohen who eats a Kohen's portion,
 a non-Kohen who serves in the Temple, and a ritually impure Kohen who 
serves in the Temple.<br>
