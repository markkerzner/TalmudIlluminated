<span style="font-size: medium;"><a href="http://bible.cc/ezekiel/20-1.htm">Ten people came and sat down 
before the prophet Ezekiel</a>. He told them &#8220;Repent!&#8221; They answered, 
&#8220;If a husband divorced his wife, do they have any claim on each other 
any longer? God has allowed us to be conquered and enslaved by 
Nebuchadnezzar, and now He has no right to punish us for our sins.&#8221; God 
answered, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/50-1.htm">Where is your 
mother's bill of divorce?</a>&#8221; It is for this reason that <a href="http://bible.cc/jeremiah/43-10.htm">God called Nebuchadnezzar His 
servant</a>, the <a href="http://bible.cc/2_samuel/3-18.htm">title given
 to the righteous King David</a> &#8211; because God knew that the people will
 make this divorce argument. Even though the Jews were conquered by 
Nebuchadnezzar, they still belong to God, since everything that the 
slave acquires belongs to the Master.<br>
<br>
Chutzpah prevails even against Heaven, for at first Balaam  was told &#8220;Do
 not go with them,&#8221; but at the end it was &#8220;Arise, go with them.&#8221;<br>
