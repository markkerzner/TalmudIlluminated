<span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/14-1.htm">A wise woman builds her house</a>&#8221;
 - this is the wife of On son of Pelet, who advised her husband to 
disassociate from  Korach, then sat at the entrance to his tent, making 
sure they don't call him. &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/14-1.htm">but the foolish one destroys it
 with her own hands</a>&#8221; - this is the wife of Korach, who instigated 
her husband to quarrel against Moses. Therefore, the commandment &#8220;don't 
be like  Korach&#8221; teaches that one should not persist in quarrel.<br>
<br>
&#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/numbers/26-11.htm%20">The sons of Korach did 
not die</a>&#8221; means that a place was set for them in Gehinnom, where they
 sat and recited God's praise for their salvation. Rabbah bar bar Chanah
 tells the following story:<br>
<br>
I was one walking on the road, and an Arab merchant told me, &#8220;Come, and I
 will show you the site of the swallowing of Korach's assembly.&#8221; He then
 went and showed two cracks in the ground which smoked. He took a ball 
of wool shearings, soaked it in water, put it on the head of a spear, 
and passed the spear over the cracks, and the wool was singed. Then the 
Arab told him to listen, and he heard, &#8220;Moses and his Torah are true, 
and they (we) are liars&#8221;<br>
