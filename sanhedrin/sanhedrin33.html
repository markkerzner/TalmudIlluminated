<span style="font-size: medium;">In monetary 
cases, if the judge realizes that the verdict was in error, it may be 
reversed. This is true whether the verdict declared the defendant either
 liable or not liable. However, in capital cases, a verdict handed down 
in favor of the accused may not be reversed. <br>
<br>
What kind of error in judgment is reversible? A clear mistake in any 
Mishnah, or a mistake in any ruling in the Talmud is considered a 
mistake on the part of the judge, and his ruling based on this can be 
reversed. What kind of error is not reversible? A matter disagreed upon 
in the Mishnah, then still disagreed in the Talmud, and currently having
 a clear consensus of the majority of the judges. If our judge ruled 
against this consensus, his ruling stands and is not reversible, even 
though it is considered a &#8220;mistake in the weighing of opinions.&#8221;<br>
