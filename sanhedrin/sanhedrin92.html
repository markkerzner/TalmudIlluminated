<span style="font-size: medium;">Of the many 
different sources in the Scripture, this one does not admit a figurative
 explanation, "<a href="http://bible.cc/daniel/12-2.htm">And many of 
those who sleep in the dusty earth shall be awaken; these for 
everlasting life, and these for shame</a>..." <br>
<br>
Said Rabbi Elazar, "If a person has understanding, it is as if the 
Temple were built in his days, for <a href="http://bible.cc/1_samuel/2-3.htm">understanding is mentioned 
between the two names of God</a>, and <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/15-17.htm">so is the Temple</a>."<br>
<br>
Regarding the <a href="http://bible.cc/ezekiel/37-1.htm">dead whom 
prophet Ezekiel resurrected</a>, there many opinions: they stood on 
their feet, uttered a song, then died; it is a parable; they went to 
Israel, married wives and fathered sons and daughters, and Rabbi Yehudah
 ben Beteira was one of their descendants.<br>
<br>
Regarding who they were, there are many opinions: that they were from 
the tribe of Ephraim, who left Egypt too early and were killed; they 
were people who denied the Resurrection of the Dead; these were people 
who covered the entire Temple with pictures of various idols.<br>
