<span style="font-size: medium;">A wayward and 
rebellious son is executed because he engages in the type of gluttony 
that will lead him to murder. He incurs liability if he eats a large 
measure of meat, called tarteimar (about 1.5 pounds), and drinks half a 
log (volume of three eggs) of Italian wine, which is habit-forming. 
Rabbi Yossi doubles these measures. <br>
<br>
He must buy that meat with the money stolen from his father, and it 
should be a repeat offender, with prior warning and flogging.<br>
<br>
If he ate it at a gathering that involves a mitzvah, or at a meal 
convened to publicize the intercalation of a day into a month, or as 
second tithe in Jerusalem, if he ate an animal that died of itself, or 
one that was not properly slaughtered, if he ate non-kosher birds or 
non-kosher seafood, if he ate something from which tithes have not been 
separated &#8211; for all these he does not earn the designation, as it says, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-20.htm">...A glutton and a guzzler</a>.&#8221;
