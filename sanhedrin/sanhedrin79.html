<span style="font-size: medium;">If one intended 
to kill an animal but killed a man instead, he is not liable, since he 
lacked the intent to kill a man. If one intended to kill an idolater but
 killed a Jew instead, he cannot be executed by a Jewish court. While it
 is certainly forbidden to kill any human being, this matter is outside 
of the jurisdiction of Sanhedrin. If one intended to kill a premature, 
nonviable baby, but killed a viable one instead, he is not liable to 
execution, because the warning given to him would have been uncertain.<br>
<br>
If he intended to strike an adult with a blow not sufficient to kill an 
adult, but it landed on a child instead, and it was sufficient to kill a
 child, and the child died, he is not liable, because he did not intend 
to commit murder, and any warning would be uncertain.<br>
<br>
If he intended to kill an adult, but it landed on a child instead, and 
the child died, the killer is liable to execution.<br>
