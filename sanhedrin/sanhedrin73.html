<span style="font-size: medium;">The following may
 be prevented from sinning at the cost of their lives, that is, they may
 be killed in order to prevent them from committing the transgression: 
one who pursues a fellow to kill him, and one who runs after a male to 
sodomize him, or after a betrothed maiden to violate her.<br>
<br>
However, the following may not be killed: one who pursues a beast for 
the purpose of sodomy, one who is about to desecrate the Sabbath, or one
 who is about to engage in idol worship. <br>
