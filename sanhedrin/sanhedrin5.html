<span style="font-size: medium;">Although three 
judges are required for monetary cases, if the judge is a widely 
recognized expert who has successfully tried many cases without error, 
he may adjudicate these cases even alone. If, in addition, he has 
received authorization to judge from a government authority (The 
Babylonian Exilarch in the time of the Talmud) then the judge is free 
from liability if he rules erroneously.<br>
<br>
It is thus understandable why one needs a permission to judge monetary 
cases. But why does he need it when judging the cases of ritual, 
provided that he is knowledgeable?  Because of a story that happened 
when one student allowed to make ritually pure dough with egg yolk (&#1502;&#1497; 
&#1489;&#1497;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, mei beitsim), and the people understood him as saying marsh water
 (&#1502;&#1497; &#1489;&#1510;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, mei betsaim). After this it was instituted that one may not 
render decisions before he gets permission from his teacher, who will 
ascertain that he has clear diction and his rulings will be understood 
properly.<br>
