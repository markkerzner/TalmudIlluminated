<span style="font-size: medium;">A wayward and 
rebellious son is judged on account of his ultimate end: having 
accustomed himself to stealing and indulgence, he will eventually rob 
and kill people. Therefore, let him die while he is still innocent, and 
not guilty of a capital crime. For the wicked, death is beneficial to 
them and to the world, but for the righteous, death is detrimental to 
them and to the world.<br>
<br>
A burglar who enters a house by tunneling through its wall is judged on 
account of his ultimate end. He is aware that the occupant of the house 
will defend his belongings, and it is therefore assumed that the burglar
 decides to kill an occupant if that becomes necessary. Therefore, the 
occupant is permitted to kill the burglar.<br>
