<span style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Yonathan 
ben Shaul said, &#8220;If a someone was pursuing a victim with the intent of 
killing him, and it was possible to save the intended victim by 
disabling one of the pursuer's limbs, and the rescuer did not save the 
victim through those means, but instead killed the pursuer, the rescuer 
is put to the death on the account of killing the pursuer.&#8221; Whether the 
rescuer is actually executed by the courts for killing the pursuer, or 
whether he is subject to death by the hands of Heaven &#8211; is a subject of 
disagreement between later authorities.<br>
<br>
If someone being pursued broke items of the pursuer, he is exempt from 
paying, but if he broke items belonging to any other person, he is 
liable. However, if the rescuer was chasing the pursuer to prevent him 
from committing murder and broke vessels of any party, he is always 
exempt, because otherwise nobody would be saving his fellow from the 
pursuer.<br>
