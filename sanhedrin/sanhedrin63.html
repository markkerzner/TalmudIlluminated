<span style="font-size: medium;">When the Jews 
worshiped the Golden Calf, they said, &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/32-8.htm">These are your gods, O Israel, 
who brought you up from the Land of Egypt</a>.&#8221;&nbsp; The word &#8220;brought&#8221; is 
in plural, as indicated by an extra letter vav. This means that the Jews
 continued to recognize the divinity of God, but paired Him with another
 entity. Had they said &#8220;brought&#8221; in singular, those who do evil to 
Israel (euphemism for the Jews themselves) would have been subject to 
extermination &#8211; this is the opinion of Rabbi Meir.<br>
<br>
However, Rabbi Shimon says that whoever pairs the name of the One in 
Heaven with something else in worship is torn from the world, for it is 
stated &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-20.htm">only to God alone</a>&#8221;
 Rather, those who worshiped the Golden Calf accepted upon themselves 
many deities in addition to the Calf. They recognized God's omnipotence,
 but they contended that He had relegated jurisdiction over the world to
 many hosts.<br>
