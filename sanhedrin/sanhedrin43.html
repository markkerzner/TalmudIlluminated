<span style="font-size: medium;"> The execution 
must be &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/24-14.htm">outside the camp</a>,&#8221;
 but how far outside? Should we compare it to the law of bulls brought 
for communal error, about which it is also stated &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/4-21.htm">outside the camp</a>,&#8221; and 
there it means outside the farthest of the three camps, or to forbidden 
sacrifice &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/17-3.htm">outside the camp</a>,&#8221;
 where &#8220;outside&#8221; means only outside one camp, the Temple proper?<br>
<br>
There are four points of commonality between execution and the law of 
bulls: removal, outside the camp, preparation (both prepare for 
something), and atonement (both atone). There are also four points of 
commonality with the forbidden sacrifices: they apply to a person, a 
sinner, a life is being taken, and sacrificial disqualification does not
 apply.<br>
<br>
However, we should rather compare those laws that prepare for something,
 thus execution is compared to the law of bulls, and the place of 
execution is removed three camps from the courthouse.<br>
