<span style="font-size: medium;">Someone bound his
 fellow by the seashore, then caused a stream of water to sweep over 
him, and thereby killed him. This was done thus - he made a hole in a 
dam that stood between the water and the victim, so that the water would
 gush out and drown the victim. In such a case, the water is considered 
like arrows that he shot at the victim, and he is liable to execution. <br>
<br>
However, this is only so when the water that reached the victim fell on 
him immediately after the barrier was breached. If some time lapsed 
before the water reached the victim, it is no longer considered the 
perpetrator's primary force, and he is not liable.<br>
<br>
As a general principle, one is liable for murder only if it was caused 
by his direct force, not by any removed or consequential action, and of 
course if he has been properly warned a short while before the action.<br>
