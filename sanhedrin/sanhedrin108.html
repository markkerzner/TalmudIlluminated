<span style="font-size: medium;">The people of the
 Generation of the Flood have no share in the World to Come, but on the 
other hand they will not have to stand in Judgment, having already been 
punished. &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/6-3.htm">My spirit shall not
 contend ever more concerning man</a>&#8221; implies neither judgment nor the 
spirit of God.<br>
<br>
The people of the Generation of Dispersion &#8211; the Tower of Babel &#8211; have 
no share in the World to Come, since God &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/11-8.htm">dispersed them</a>&#8221; in this 
world and &#8220;scattered&#8221; for the World to Come. <br>
<br>
The people of Sodom have no share in the World to Come, since they were 
&#8220;wicked&#8221; (this world) and &#8220;sinful&#8221; (World to Come).<br>
<br>
The people of the Generation of the Wilderness have no share in the 
World to Come, since they shall be &#8220;consumed&#8221; and &#8220;there they shall die&#8221;
 - these are the words of Rabbi Akiva. Rabbi Eliezer disagrees and 
applies to them &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/psalms/50-5.htm">Gather to Me 
My devout ones, those who sealed a  covenant with Me by sacrifice</a>.&#8221;<br>
