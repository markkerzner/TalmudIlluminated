<span style="font-size: medium;">The Noahide 
marital laws are derived from &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=2">therefore
 shall a man leave his father and his mother and cling to his wife</a>...,&#8221;
 - but not to the wife of his fellow, not to an animal, etc.<br>
<br>
A Noahite is permitted to marry his daughter. If you ask, why did Adam 
not marry his daughter? - so that Cain could marry his sister, based on 
&#8220;The world will be built through kindness&#8221; in Psalms. A Noahite is also 
permitted to marry his sister. Didn't we just say that &#8220;The world will 
be built through kindness&#8221; allowed Cain to marry his sister, but 
otherwise it would be prohibited?! True, but once it was permitted to 
Cain, it remained permitted.<br>
