<span style="font-size: medium;">All those who are
 stoned are subsequently hung &#8211; these are the words of Rabbi Eliezer, 
but the Sages say, &#8220;Only the blasphemer and the idolater are hung after 
stoning.&#8221;<br>
<br>
A man is hung facing the people, and a woman is hung facing the gallows &#8211;
 these are the words of Rabbi Eliezer, but the Sages say, &#8220;Only a man is
 hung; a woman is not hung at all.&#8221;<br>
<br>
How do they hang a man? They sink a post vertically into the ground, and
 a beam protrudes from it. The hangman brings together two hands of the 
corpse one upon the other and hangs him by his hands from the beam. 
Rabbi Yose says, &#8220;The post is leaned on an angle against the wall and he
 hangs him in the way that butchers do.&#8221;<br>
<br>
After he is hung, they untie him immediately, remove him from the 
gallows, and bury him.<br>
