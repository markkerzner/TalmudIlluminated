<span style="font-size: medium;">The Jewish year 
is luni-solar. Since twelve lunar months are less than a solar year by 
eleven days, and since Passover has to be in spring, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/16-1.htm">Guard the month of young 
grain to celebrate Passover</a>...&#8221;, an extra month is at times 
inserted. The judges who decide when to insert a month need to be 
appointed on the day before the discussion.<br>
<br>
It once happened that Rabban Gamliel invited seven judges, but eight 
assembled. Rabban Gamliel then said, &#8220;He who was not invited, should 
exit,&#8221; on which Shmuel the Minor, who was in fact the greatest of them, 
exited, taking the blame on himself and sparing humiliation of the 
uninvited one. <br>
<br>
Rabbi Meir learned from him. When a woman came to his academy claiming 
that one of his students betrothed her through cohabitation, Rabbi Meir 
was the first to give her a Get (divorce), and then all the students 
followed suit.<br>
