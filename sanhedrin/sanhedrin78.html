<span style="font-size: medium;">If ten people 
beat someone with ten clubs and he died, whether they hit him all at the
 same time or one after the other, they are not liable to execution.<br>
<br>
If they hit him one after the other, the last nine are not liable 
because they struck a man who would have died anyway, and the first 
assailant is not liable because there is a remote possibility that the 
man would have recovered had the others not continue beating him. If 
they hit him simultaneously, each one can plead that the victim might 
have lived if not for the blows of others. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira 
makes the last one liable. Both derive their rulings from &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/24-17.htm">if a man strikes all human 
life</a>...&#8221; <br>
<br>
If someone struck his fellow, and the judges assumed that he would die, 
but he recovered somewhat, and then deteriorated and died, the attacker 
is liable. Rabbi Nechemiah makes him not liable, since there are grounds
 for asserting that the victim did not die a result of the attacker's 
blow.<br>
