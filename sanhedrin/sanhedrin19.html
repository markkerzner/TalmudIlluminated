<span style="font-size: medium;">A king may 
neither judge nor be judged. This refers to later kings, but kings of 
Davidic line may judge and therefore be judged, as Resh Lakish explained
 &#8220;First correct yourself, and then correct others&#8221; -&nbsp; only a person who 
is subject to correction may correct others.<br>
<br>
But why may the other kings not judge or be judged? Because of an 
incident that once occurred. A slave of King Yannai killed a person, and
 Shimon ben Shetach called King Yannai to court - because of &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/21-29.htm">and its owner had been warned by
 witnesses</a>...&#8221;&nbsp; &#8211; the king, the owner of the slave, has to be in 
court. Yannai came and sat down. Shimon ben Shetach told him to stand 
up, but the king said, &#8220;I will do as your colleagues will say.&#8221; All the 
members of the Sanhedrin were looking into the ground. Shimon ben 
Shetach said &#8220;You are men of thought! May the Master of thoughts exact 
retribution from you!&#8221; - and they died. The Sages then decreed that a 
king may neither judge nor be judged.<br>
