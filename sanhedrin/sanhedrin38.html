<span style="font-size: medium;">Said Rabbi 
Eliezer: &#8220;Be diligent in the study of Torah and know what to answer a 
heretic,&#8221; so that you can answer the challenges that are based on 
Scripture. Said Rabbi Yochanan, &#8220;That is only with regard to a pagan 
heretic, but as for a Jewish heretic, do not debate him, for he will 
become even more heretical.&#8221; <br>
<br>
Continued Rabbi Yochanan, &#8220;Wherever the heretics have used a verse in 
Scripture as support for their arguments, the rebuttal can be found in a
 nearby verse.&#8221; For example, it is written &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/1-26.htm">Let us (plural) make man in our 
(plural) image</a>...&#8221; But the next verse says, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/genesis/1-27.htm">God created man in His image</a>...&#8221;
 Then why is the plural form used at all? To show that The Holy One, 
Blessed is He, never does anything unless He first consults with the 
Heavenly Court.<br>
