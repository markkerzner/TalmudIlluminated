<span style="font-size: medium;">The 
disqualification of relatives is absolute: they may not testify whether 
their testimony is favorable or detrimental. The relatives include: 
one's brother, uncle, sister's husband, aunt's husband, father-in-law, 
brother-in-law, and also their sons and sons-in-law.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Yehudah says: &#8220;One's close friend and one's enemy are also 
disqualified.&#8221; But the Sages say that the Jewish people are not 
suspected of bearing false witness about someone because of love or 
animosity.<br>
<br>
How does one understand &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Fathers
 shall not be put to death because of their sons nor shall sons be put 
to death because of their fathers</a>...&#8221;? We already know that &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">each man shall be put to 
death only because of his own sin</a>.&#8221; Therefore, we have to understand
 that &#8220;Fathers shall not be put to death because of the testimony of 
their sons.&#8221;<br>
