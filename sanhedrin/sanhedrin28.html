The relatives include: one's brother, uncle, sister's husband, aunt's husband, father-in-law, brother-in-law, and also their sons and sons-in-law. <br/> <br/> Rabbi Yehudah says: "One's close friend and one's enemy are also disqualified." But the Sages say that the Jewish people are not suspected of bearing false witness about someone because of love or animosity. <br/> <br/> How does one understand " <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Fathers shall not be put to death because of their sons nor shall sons be put to death because of their fathers</a> ..."? We already know that "... <a href = "http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">each man shall be put to death only because of his own sin</a> ." Therefore, we have to understand that "Fathers shall not be put to death because of the testimony of their sons." <br/> <br/> Art: Isaac Oliver - The Browne Brothers</body></html>
