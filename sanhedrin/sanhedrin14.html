<span style="font-size: medium;">If the body of a 
murder victim is discovered outside a town in the Land of Israel and it 
is not known who killed him, the town nearest to where the body was 
found has to take a calf that was never worked and bring it to a valley 
of unworked ground, <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-1.htm">where
 it is decapitated</a>. <br>
<br>
Measuring which town is nearest has to be carried out by three judges, 
members of the Great Sanhedrin. The decapitation of the calf is then 
performed by the court of the town which is nearest.<br>
<br>
Normally, however, the members of the Sanhedrin do not leave the Chamber
 of Hewn Stones in the Temple, since &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/songs/7-2.htm">Your navel is like a moon-shaped 
basin; let not the strength of the blend diminish</a>...&#8221; is </span><span style="font-size: medium;"> talking </span><span style="font-size: medium;">allegorically about the members of the Sanhedrin, who sat in a 
semicircle.<br>
