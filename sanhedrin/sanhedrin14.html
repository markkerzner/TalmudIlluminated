The decapitation of the calf is then performed by the court of the town which is nearest. <br/> <br/> Normally, however, the members of the Sanhedrin do not leave the Chamber of Hewn Stones in the Temple, since " <a href = "null">Your navel is like a moon-shaped basin; let not the strength of the blend diminish</a> ..." is talking allegorically about the members of the Sanhedrin, who sat in a semicircle. <br/> <br/> Art: Honor√© Daumier - The Stomach of the Legislature the Ministerial Benches of 1834</body></html>
