<span style="font-size: medium;">Rav Acha says  
that according to Biblical law, one judge is qualified to adjudicate 
loan cases, because &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/19-15.htm">with
 justice shall thou judge your fellow</a>&#8221; is expressed in singular form
 &#8220;thou.&#8221; However, because of the concern that a solitary judge might be 
chosen from commoners, not knowledgeable in monetary law, the Sages 
decreed that three judges are necessary even in loan cases. <br>
<br>
But could three judges not be all commoners, not knowledgeable in 
monetary law? - No, at least one of them will have picked some 
knowledge. If so, they should not be liable for errors, like 
professional judges? Were they to be exempt, they would be even more 
ignorant corner dwellers.<br>
<br>
In the verses of &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/22-8.htm">the 
master of the house shall approach a judge</a>...&#8221; the word &#8220;judge&#8221; is 
mentioned three times, so three judges are needed. However, Rebbi says 
that five judges are needed to start, so that at least three reach the 
same conclusion.<br>
