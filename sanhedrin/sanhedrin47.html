<span style="font-size: medium;">Is burial 
practiced because it avoids disgrace to the deceased and his family, or 
is it practiced because it gains atonement for the deceased? When would 
it make a difference? When one declares that after he dies he does not 
wish his corpse be buried. If burial is because of the disgrace to his 
family, he cannot refuse burial and thus disgrace his family. If it is 
because of his own atonement &#8211; he has clearly stated that he does not 
want atonement, and there would be no reason to bury him.<br>
<br>
The Talmud does not resolve this question, but the prevailing practice 
is that if one does not wish to be buried, his wishes are disregarded.<br>
<br>
Is eulogy delivered for the honor of the living, that is, the relatives 
who survive the deceased, or is it for the honor of the dead? Since the 
deceased receives atonement though various disgraces if they befall his 
corpse, it follows that a eulogy is for the honor of the dead person 
himself.<br>
