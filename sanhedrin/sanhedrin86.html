<span style="font-size: medium;">A sage who rebels
 against the word of  the High Court is executed by strangulation.<br>
<br>
There were three courts in Jerusalem, one sitting at the entrance to the
 Temple Mount, one higher up on the Temple Mount, sitting at the 
entrance of the Temple Courtyard, and one even higher up the Mount 
sitting in the Chamber of Hewn Stone.<br>
<br>
The dissenting sage and his disputants on the local court would come to 
the court at the entrance to the Temple Mount, and the dissenting sage 
would say before the court, &#8220;Thus have I expounded, and thus have my 
colleagues expounded, thus have I taught, and thus have my colleagues 
taught.&#8221; If the judges of the court have heard from their teachers the 
answer, they tell the disputants the law, and if not, they go to a 
higher court. There the procedure is repeated. If the highest court have
 a tradition, they tell it, and if not, they decide it, and it becomes 
binding.<br>
