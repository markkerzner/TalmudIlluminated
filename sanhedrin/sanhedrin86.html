If the judges of the court have heard from their teachers the answer, they tell the disputants the law, and if not, they go to a higher court. There the procedure is repeated. If the highest court have a tradition, they tell it, and if not, they decide it, and it becomes binding. <br/> <br/> Jean-Léon Gérôme - Dispute D'Arabes</body></html>
