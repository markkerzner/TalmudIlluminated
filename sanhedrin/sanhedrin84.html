<span style="font-size: medium;">The complete <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/04/sanhedrin-53-who-is-stoned.html">procedure
 for strangulation was described earlier</a>.<br>
<br>
The following are executed by strangulation: one who strikes his father 
or his mother and inflicts a wound; one who kidnaps a Jewish person, 
works him, then sells him as a slave; a sage who rebels against the word
 of the High Court; a false prophet; one who prophesies in the name of a
 false god; one who commits adultery; false witnesses against a daughter
 of a Kohen; and a man who illicitly cohabited with the daughter of a 
Kohen.<br>
<br>
Even though the witnesses have tried to impose the punishment of burning
 on the daughter of a Kohen, when they are disqualified as false  
witnesses, they receive the punishment appropriate for the adulterer, 
and not the adulteress, because of &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/19-19.htm">as he conspired to do to 
his brother</a>.&#8221;<br>
