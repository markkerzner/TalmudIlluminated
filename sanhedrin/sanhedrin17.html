<span style="font-size: medium;">The Great 
Sanhedrin was composed on seventy one judges, since Moses is counted as 
part of it. Rabbi Yehudah, however, says that the Sanhedrin had only 
seventy judges, since Moses is not counted among them.<br>
<br>
Moses selected six judges from each of the twelve tribes. Then he used 
lottery tickets which either said &#8220;Sage&#8221; or were empty. However, Eldad 
and Meidad remained in the camp, since they thought themselves not 
worthy (alternatively, they were afraid not to be selected). Instead, 
they were granted prophesy.<br>
<br>
The members of the Sanhedrin must be men of height, of wisdom, of 
moderate old age, acquainted with witchcraft, and who know seventy 
languages, so that they hear the testimony directly and not through an 
interpreter. They should be able to prove from the Torah that an 
obviously non-kosher thing is in fact kosher. <br>
