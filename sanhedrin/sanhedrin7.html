<span style="font-size: medium;">Rav Huna said, 
&#8220;Discord is comparable to a channel from an overflowing river &#8211; once it 
starts, it will continue to widen&#8221; - as in Proverbs, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/17-14.htm">The opening of a channel is a 
beginning of a discord</a>.&#8221; Abaye Kashisha said, &#8220;Discord is like a 
plank in a bridge: once people walk on it, it becomes firm and stays 
firm.&#8221;<br>
<br>
One man liked to say, &#8220;Fortunate is one who hears his denigration 
without responding. A hundred misfortunes will pass him by.&#8221; Said Rav 
Yehudah, &#8220;beginning of discord (&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;)&#8220; can be translated as 
beginning of a hundred misfortunes (&#1512;&#1497;&#1513; &#1502;&#1488;&#1492; &#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;).<br>
<br>
One man liked to say, &#8220;When our love was strong, we could have lain 
together on the width of a sword, but now a bed of sixty amot (100 feet)
 does not suffice for us.&#8221; Said Rav Huna - and so it is with God, at 
first it was "...<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/25-22.htm">and I will 
meet you (Moses) there and speak to you</a>..." from above the ten 
hand-breadth </span><span style="font-size: medium;">Ark</span><span style="font-size: medium;">, but later about the Temple built by Solomon
 &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/66-1.htm">Says God - what house can
 you build for me</a>?&#8221;</span><br>
