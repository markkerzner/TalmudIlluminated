Abaye Kashisha said, "Discord is like a plank in a bridge: once people walk on it, it becomes firm and stays firm." <br/> <br/> One man liked to say, "Fortunate is one who hears his denigration without responding. A hundred misfortunes will pass him by." Said Rav Yehudah, "beginning of discord (ראשית מדון)" can be translated as beginning of a hundred misfortunes (ריש מאה דיני). <br/> <br/> One man liked to say, "When our love was strong, we could have lain together on the width of a sword, but now a bed of sixty amot (100 feet) does not suffice for us." Said Rav Huna - and so it is with God, at first it was "... and I will meet you (Moses) there and speak to you ..." from above the ten hand-breadth Ark , but later about the Temple built by Solomon "... <a href = "null">Says God - what house can you build for me</a> ?" <br/> <br/> Art: Vincent Van Gogh - Bridge at Arles</body></html>
