<span style="font-size: medium;">Both monetary and
 capital cases are subject to the requirement of inquiry and 
questioning. Inquiry refers to time and place, questioning to the 
particulars of the testimony. That the court proceedings should be 
uniform is required by &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/24-22.htm">There
 shall be one law for you</a>...&#8221; <br>
<br>
However, in the cases of loans the Sages waved this requirement, in 
order to make it easier for the borrowers to obtain funds. How could the
 Sages abrogate a Torah law? They utilized the power that the Torah 
gives to the court, allowing it to confiscate property and then award it
 to the winner, without complete interrogation. If the court sees a 
possibility of fraud, the questioning is required. <br>
<br>
In general, one should try to take his case to the court of more 
prominent Sages, because in doing so he will learn additional Torah 
laws.<br>
