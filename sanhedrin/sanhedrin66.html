<span style="font-size: medium;">One who curses 
his father or his mother is not liable unless he curses them with the 
Name of God. If he cursed them with a subordinate Name of God &#8211; Rabbi 
Meir holds him liable, but the Sages exempt him.<br>
<br>
One who cohabits with a young maiden is not <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/22-21.htm">liable to be stoned</a>&nbsp; 
unless she is young (naarah), virgin, betrothed, and still in her 
father's house. A naarah is a girl of twelve years old who has sprouted 
two pubic hairs; she remains a naarah until she is twelve and a half. 
Virgin &#8211; but if she had intimate relations, their punishment is standard
 - strangulation. Betrothed &#8211; the first stage of marriage (kiddushin) 
has been performed, but there was no hupah, so she is yet not allowed to
 live with her husband. If two men cohabited with her (anally), the 
first one is liable to stoning, and the second one &#8211; to strangulation.<br>
