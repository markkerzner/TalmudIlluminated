This is true for any day, even Monday. <br/> <br/> Rabbi Yochanan said that an idolater who engrosses himself in Torah study is liable to death, as it says " <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=33">Moses commanded us the Torah; it is an inheritance</a> ..." But did not Rabbi Meir say that he is rather like a High Priest, because it says about that laws of the Torah "... <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=18">That a man should keep them and live by them</a> ." - any man, even an idolater? - This refers to the seven Noahide laws. <br/> <br/> Adam, the first man, was commanded to subsist on vegetation, "... <a href = "http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=1">it shall be yours for food</a> ..." If so, why was he given dominion over animals? Only for work. For fish? Only for work. But can fish do work? - Yes, since it is prohibited to use a combination of fish and goat for pulling a wagon. Why was he then specifically prohibited a limb torn from a living animal? - Adam was allowed to eat an animal that died of itself. <br/> <br/> Art: Jean Simeon Chardin - Girl Peeling Vegetables</body></html>
