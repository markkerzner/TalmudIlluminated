<span style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Zakkai 
taught the following in the academy of Rabbi Yochanan: "If one 
slaughtered an offering, burnt an offering, poured a libation and bowed 
down to an idol, and he did all of these acts unintentionally in one 
period of unawareness, without realizing between the acts that he had 
committed a transgression, he is liable to bring only one sin offering."
 Said Rabbi Yochanan to him, &#8220;Leave my study hall and teach this ruling 
outside; it is incorrect.&#8221;<br>
<br>
What was their disagreement? Rabbi Zakkai compared the rules of idol 
worship to the rules of Sabbath. About Sabbath it says, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=2&amp;CHAPTER=35%20">Do
 not ignite any fire, no matter where you live</a>.&#8221; Since all manner of
 work is already prohibited, this extra commandment teaches how to treat
 multiple violations &#8211; according to some, as separate transgressions, 
and according to others as one single transgression. Rabbi Zakkai 
followed the &#8220;single transgression&#8221; rule. However, Rabbi Yochanan held 
that the laws of idol worship are not comparable to the laws of Sabbath 
in this respect.<br>
