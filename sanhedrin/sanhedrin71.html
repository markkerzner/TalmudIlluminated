<span style="font-size: medium;">To become a 
&#8220;wayward and rebellious son,&#8221; the boy must steal money, spend it on meat
 and wine, and then consume the requisite amounts of these things. If he
 stole from his father and ate in his father's domain, or if he stole 
from others and ate in the domain of others &#8211; he does not qualify as a 
wayward and rebellious son, unless he steals from his father and eats in
 the domain of others. Rabbi Yose says, not until he steals from both 
his father and from his mother. <br>
<br>
The boy is not declared a wayward and rebellious son until both his 
father and mother are willing. If one of the parents is missing a hand 
or is lame, mute, blind, or deaf &#8211; the son does not become a wayward and
 rebellious son, because the parents need to be able to &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-19.htm">seize him...take him...and 
say</a>...&#8221;<br>
