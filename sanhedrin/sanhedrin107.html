<span style="font-size: medium;">David wanted to 
be mentioned in one breath with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. God told him,
 &#8220;I tested them, but I did not test you.&#8221; David said, &#8220;Test me!&#8221; God 
told him, &#8220;I will, and I will even tell you what the test will be &#8211; 
women.&#8221; David then increased relations with his wife, and he forgot that
 this only increases the desire. <br>

Bathsheba was shampooing her head underneath a canopy. Satan appeared to
 David in the form of a bird. David shot his arrow at it, and the arrow 
struck and opened the canopy, making Bathsheba exposed to view. David 
took her and then sent her back home. Technically, Bathsheba was 
divorced, but it looked like David sinned with a married woman. David 
said, &#8220;I could have withstood the test, but I did not want people to say
 that a student mastered his teacher (God).&#8221; David understood that his 
role in life was not of a Patriarch, but of a penitent human. David then
 suffered for six months to expiate his sin.<br>
