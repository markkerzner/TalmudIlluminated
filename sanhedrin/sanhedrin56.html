<span style="font-size: medium;">The blasphemer  
is one who &#8220;blesses&#8221;, (that is, curses) the Divine Name of God. The act 
of blasphemy is always referred to in the Talmud by the euphemism, 
&#8220;blessing.&#8221; The blasphemer is not liable unless he pronounces the Divine
 Name, yud, keh, vav, keh. In referring to the Tetragrammaton name of 
God, it is accepted practice to modify the spelling and to pronounce the
 letter &#8220;heh&#8221; as &#8220;keh&#8221;.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah describes the trial procedure. Whenever the 
judges examine the witnesses, they use a pseudonym, asking the 
witnesses, for example, whether the accused said, &#8220;May Yose strike 
Yose.&#8221; When the case is completed, however, they may not execute the 
offender based on a pseudonym. Rather, they send everyone out of the 
courtroom and then ask the most eminent of the witnesses, &#8220;State 
explicitly what you heard the blasphemer say,&#8221; and he says it. Upon 
hearing the blasphemy, the judges stand up and rend their garments, and 
never repair them. The second witness then says, &#8220;I too have heard as he
 did.&#8221; There is not need for him to repeat the exact words.<br>
