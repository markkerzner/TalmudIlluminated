<span style="font-size: medium;">When witnesses 
would come to court to testify that someone transgressed a capital 
offense, they would be admonished in order to discourage them from 
testifying falsely: &#8220;Perhaps you will say your testimony based on 
conjecture or hearsay, or as witnesses repeating testimony from another 
witnesses, even though that other witness is a trustworthy person. 
Perhaps you do not realize that we will eventually examine you with 
inquiries and questions. Know that capital cases are not like monetary 
cases: in monetary cases a person may pay back the money he unjustly 
caused someone to loose and receive atonement, but in capital cases, the
 blood of the accused and the blood of his descendants are the witness' 
responsibility until eternity.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Therefore the first man was created alone, and also so that everyone 
should say, &#8220;For my sake the world was created&#8221; - and he should be 
careful not to bring about his downfall by committing a transgression. 
Now, perhaps you will say, &#8220;What need have we for all this trouble?&#8221; - <a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/5-1.htm">If you were a witness and saw 
the event, you must testify</a>.&nbsp;  And perhaps you will say, &#8220;What need 
have we to incur responsibility for this man's blood?&#8221; - be secure, for &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/proverbs/11-10.htm">...when the wicked perish 
there is joy</a>.&#8221; <br>
