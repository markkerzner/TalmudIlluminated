<span style="font-size: medium;">Michah <a href="http://bible.cc/judges/17-1.htm">made an idol that many Jews 
worshiped</a>, but he is not mentioned as not having a share in the 
World to Come. Why? Because his bread was always available for 
wayfarers. <br>
<br>
As a reward for Jethro's saying, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/2-20.htm">Call him (Moses) and let him eat 
bread</a>&#8221;, Jethro's descendants merited to be members of the Sanhedrin.<br>
<br>
If only <a href="http://bible.cc/1_samuel/20-1.htm">Jonathan had 
escorted David with two loaves of bread</a>, the people of Nov would not
 have been killed, Doeg would not been banished from the World to Come, 
and Saul and his three sons would not have been killed.&nbsp;</span><br>

<span style="font-size: medium;"><br>
The sins of the kings of Judah led Jerusalem's destruction, as described
 in the Book of Lamentations, which starts with &#8220;<a href="http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3201.htm">How does she 
(Jerusalem) sits in solitude!</a>&#8221; Why was the word &#8220;How&#8221; (Eicha) used 
to describe Israel's fallen state? Because the numerical value of Eicha 
is thirty-six, and the Jews transgressed all thirty-six sins mentioned 
in the Torah that carry the penalty of excision. Furthermore, the Book 
of Lamentations is arranged in the alphabetical order, because they 
violated the entire Torah, from the first to the last letter of the 
alphabet.<br>
