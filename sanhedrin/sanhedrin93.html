<span style="font-size: medium;">Chananyah, 
Mishael, and Azaryah refused the demand of Nebuchadnezzar to bow down to
 an idol, and were thrown into a fiery furnace. Six miracles occurred 
for them. The furnace rose to ground level, the walls of the furnace 
were breached, and the foundation caved - so that everyone could see 
them inside the fire unscathed. The golden image on top of it was 
overturned on its face; the elite Nebuchadnezzar guards were burned by 
the furnace's fire, and Ezekiel resurrected the dead in the plain of 
Dura.<br>
<br>
When they came out of the fiery furnace unscathed, all the nations of 
the world came and struck the enemies of Israel (euphemism for the Jews 
themselves) on the faces and said to them "You have such a powerful God 
and yet you submit to Nebuchadnezzar's threat and bow to the idol?!" 
Chananyah, Mishael, and Azaryah immediately began to declare: "<a href="http://bible.cc/daniel/9-7.htm">Yours, O Lord, is the 
righteousness, and ours is the shamefacedness as of this day</a>."<br>
