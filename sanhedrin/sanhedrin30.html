<span style="font-size: medium;">Ordinarily,  <a href="http://mkerzner.blogspot.com/2010/03/sanhedrin-29-courtroom-proceedings-and.html">the
 verdict is handed down orally</a>.  However, the loosing litigant is 
entitled to a written record of the verdict. Rabbi Yochanan says that 
the verdict reads &#8220;He is not liable&#8221;, and individual opinions of the 
judges are not recorded, because of &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/19-16.htm">Do not be a gossipmonger</a>...&#8221;
 Resh Lakish holds that the names of the judges are recorded with their 
opinions of &#8220;liable&#8221; or &#8220;not liable,&#8221; because otherwise the verdict has 
the appearance of a lie. Rabbi Elazar finds a compromise: &#8220;Through their
 words so-and-so was found not liable&#8221; - which implies that the verdict 
was not unanimous.<br>
<br>
The testimonies of the two witnesses are not combined unless they 
witness the event together. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korchah says that even if
 they witness two separate events that occur one after another, their 
testimonies may be combined. The first teacher maintains that the maneh 
(100 shekels) of one testimony is not the maneh of the other. But Rabbi 
Yehoshua ben Korchah says that they testify about a maneh in general.<br>
