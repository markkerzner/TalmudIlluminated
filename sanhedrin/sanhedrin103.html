<span style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Yochanan 
said, &#8220;Whoever says that Menasheh has no portion in the World to Come 
weakens the resolve of potential penitents&#8221; - since Menasheh repented 
for the last thirty-three years of his life. To accept Menasheh's 
repentance, God made a secret tunnel in the firmament, to hide this from
 the Attribute of Justice.<br>
<br>
Of the things that the bad Jewish kings used to do, Menasheh scratched 
out the names of God from Torah scrolls and replaced them with different
 pagan deities, he also tore down the altar in the Temple; Amon burned 
the Torah and prohibited the bringing of sacrifice. Menasheh had 
relations with his sister, but Amon had relations with his mother, as it
 states, &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/2_chronicles/33-23.htm">Amon did ever
 more evil</a>.&#8221; His mother asked him, &#8220;Can you have any pleasure from 
the source from which you issued?&#8221; He answered, &#8220;Am I doing this for any
 purpose other than to vex my Creator?&#8221;<br>
