<span style="font-size: medium;">It is certainly 
forbidden to use a corpse for anything, or to derive benefit from its 
accessory items. When does this prohibition go into effect? Abaye says 
that the prohibition applies from the moment the item is designated to 
serve the needs of the corpse, but Rava maintains that it starts from 
the time that item is actually used in its new capacity. <br>
<br>
Abaye derives his view by comparison with <a href="http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/21-4.htm">the decapitated heifer</a>: 
just as the heifer becomes forbidden when it is led into a rocky 
uncultivated valley, so too, all designated items are already viewed as 
if serving their purpose. However, Rava compares this with accessories 
to idolatry, which do not become forbidden through mere designation. 
What is Rava's reason? - We should derive accessory (for the corpse) 
from accessory (for idol worship), and not compare to heifer, which is 
the item in question itself.<br>
