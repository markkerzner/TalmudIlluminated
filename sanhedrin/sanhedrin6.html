<span style="font-size: medium;">Rabbi Eliezer ben
 R. Yossi says, &#8220;It is forbidden for a judge to arbitrate a compromise.&#8221;
 It is certainly permissible for disputants to settle out of court, or 
to ask an arbitrator to help them. However, once they come to court, the
 judge who arbitrates a compromise shows that in his opinion the 
compromise settlement is more correct than an appropriate ruling based 
on Torah law. Furthermore, in settlement the would-be winner is robbed 
of some money.<br>
<br>
Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha </span><span style="font-size: medium;">says</span><span style="font-size: medium;"> on the contrary that before the verdict it 
is a meritorious deed for a judge to arbitrate a compromise - &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/zechariah/8-16.htm">execute truth and judgment of 
piece</a>...&#8221;, and &#8220;judgment of piece&#8221; means compromise - like king 
David, who &#8220;...<a href="http://bible.cc/2_samuel/8-15.htm">rendered 
judgment and righteousness</a>...&#8221; And Rabbi Eliezer explains that king 
David would render a strict judgment first, but then if the loosing 
party was poor, he would pay his own money.<br>
