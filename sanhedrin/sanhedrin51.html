<span style="font-size: medium;">&#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/leviticus/21-9.htm">If a daughter of a Kohen 
starts being promiscuous, her father she profanes</a>...&#8221;  Said Rabbi 
Eliezer in explanation of this, &#8220;With her father by burning; with her 
father-in-law by stoning.&#8221;<br>
<br>
If a daughter of a Kohen who is either betrothed or fully married 
commits adultery, then her punishment is correspondingly greater than 
that of her lover, who is punished by strangulation. But what is the 
meaning of Rabbi Eliezer's cryptic statement? If he meant that she 
commits adultery with either her father or her father-in-law, then his 
ruling is true even for a daughter of an Yisrael, and he did not have to
 state it. Rather, &#8220;with her father&#8221; means &#8220;in the domain of her 
father&#8221;, that is, betrothed, and &#8220;with her father-in-law&#8221; means &#8220;in the 
domain of her father-in-law&#8221;, that is, fully married.<br>
<br>
There were other explanations, but Rav Nachman said &#8220;The law is like the
 first explanation.&#8221; Said Rav Yosef, &#8220;The law?!? There are not capital 
punishments today!&#8221; Said Abaye, &#8220;Should we not learn the laws of 
sacrifices because they are not relevant today? We do learn them, and 
receive reward for learning!&#8221; And Rav Yosef meant that when the Messiah 
comes and resurrects the dead, we will ask Rabbi Eliezer himself.<br>
