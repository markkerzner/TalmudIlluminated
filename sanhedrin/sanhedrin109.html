<span style="font-size: medium;">Eliezer, the 
servant of Abraham, once said to Noah's son, Shem the Great, &#8220;Life in 
the ark was naturally hard for the animals, but what about you, the 
humans?&#8221; Shem answered that they indeed endured great distress. Animals 
had to be fed by day or by night, depending on their habits, and Noah 
with his sons was always busy. There was a small bird resembling quail, 
called Zikita, and Noah did not know what it ate. Once he was standing 
eating a pomegranate, a worm fell out, and the bird ate it. After this, 
Noah would prepare bran until it would become wormy, then feed the worms
 to the bird.<br>
<br>
There was a bird named Chol (possibly Phoenix) which Noah found lying in
 its quarters in the Ark, not outside waiting for food. He asked, &#8220;You 
don't want to eat?&#8221; The bird answered, &#8220;I saw how preoccupied you were, 
so I did not want to trouble you with feeding me.&#8221; Touched, Noah said, 
&#8220;May be it God's will that you will never die!&#8221; and it was fulfilled in &#8220;<a href="http://bible.cc/job/29-18.htm">I shall die with my nest intact 
and live for many days like chol</a>.&#8221;<br>
