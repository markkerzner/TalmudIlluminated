<span style="font-size: medium;">When Joshua 
inquired why Israel was defeated at the hands of Ai, God replied, 
&#8220;Israel has sinned&#8221; - they have taken the items from the ban. Joshua 
then said, &#8220;Master of the Universe, who is the individual who has 
sinned?&#8221; God replied, &#8220;Am I your talebearer? Go cast lots!&#8221;<br>
<br>
The lot fell on Achan. Achan, however, told Joshua, &#8220;A lot is no proof! 
It had to fall on somebody.&#8221; &#8220;Please&#8221;, begged Joshua, &#8220;acknowledge your 
guilt and you will be spared. In the future, Israel is to be divided by 
casting lots. Please don't cast aspersions on it now.&#8221; Achan confessed 
and was executed.<br>
<br>
Joshua then hurled the booty in front of God and told him, &#8220;Because of 
this transgression the great person, Yair ben Menasheh, who is 
comparable to the greater part of the Sanhedrin, had to die?&#8221; God told 
Joshua, &#8220;Your transgression is even worse. At night, when not fighting, 
you should not have neglected the Torah study.&#8221; The next night Joshua 
corrected this.<br>
