<span style="font-size: medium;"> When the 
condemned person was 4 amot (about 6 feet) from the stoning grounds, 
they would remove his clothing, except for a piece of material to cover 
his genitals, so as not to prolong his agony by the cushioning effect of
 the clothes. A woman remains also covered from the back &#8211; so says Rabbi
 Yehudah, but the Sages maintain that a woman is not stoned naked, 
rather, she is dressed in a single plain garment.<br>
<br>
The elevation of the stoning grounds was twice a man's height. One of 
the witnesses pushes the condemned man by his hips, so that he falls on 
the side. If he dies from this fall, the court has fulfilled its 
obligation. If not, the second witness picks up a stone and casts it 
upon his chest. If he dies from this, it is sufficient; if not, all 
present throw rocks at him.<br>
