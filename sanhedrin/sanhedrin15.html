<span style="font-size: medium;">Produce grown in 
the Land of Israel must have tithes separated from it, with the second 
tithe taken to Jerusalem and consumed there. If one wants to redeem it 
for money, and if its value is not known, three people are required to 
estimate it. Three merchant appraisers are required for this, and they 
can even be partners.<br>
<br>
Items consecrated to the Temple need three appraisers to be redeemed, 
and consecrated lands need nine appraisers and a Kohen.<br>
<br>
All cases of capital crimes require the Small Sanhedrin of twenty three 
judges. If an animal is involved, like in the cases of sodomy, or when 
an animal kills a human, the animal is judged by the court of 
twenty-three, similar to human cases.<br>
