<span style="font-size: medium;">One is allowed to
 gather produce of the seventh year (Shmita), but not trade in it. 
Initially both </span><span style="font-size: medium;">Shmita </span><span style="font-size: medium;">gatherers and traders were disqualified from
 serving as witnesses. However, when the ruling power began to collect 
tax in the seventh year, Rabbi Yannai allowed to plant on Shmita, since 
Shmita today is only a decree of the Sages. After this only merchants 
remained disqualified.<br>
<br>
Once during Shmita Resh Lakish joined Rabbi Chiya and Rabbi Shimon, to 
observe the procedure of calculating a leap year. He saw a man plowing 
and said &#8220;This man is a Kohen and he is plowing.&#8221; (Kohanim were 
especially suspect). They answered, &#8220;He might say that he is just a 
worker.&#8221; He then saw a man pruning and said &#8220;Kohen is pruning.&#8221; They 
answered, &#8220;He may say that he needs the branches.&#8221;<br>
<br>
They said, &#8220;This fellow is argumentative.&#8221; When they reached the meeting
 place, they ascended and pulled the ladder up, to prevent him from 
joining.<br>
