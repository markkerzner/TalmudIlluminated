<span style="font-size: medium;">When king 
Chizkiah was ill and then recovered, <a href="http://bible.cc/isaiah/38-8.htm">the sun reversed its course</a>. 
The king of Assyria sent him a letter, &#8220;Greeting to Chizkiah, greetings 
to Jerusalem, greetings to the great God!&#8221; Nebuchadnezzar was the king's
 secretary, and he ran after the messenger in order to rewrite this 
letter in the correct order of greetings. He made three steps and was 
rewarded with the opportunity to destroy Jerusalem. People now make 
three steps at the end of prayer, asking to restore Jerusalem.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://bible.cc/jeremiah/52-12.htm">The general who came to 
destroy Jerusalem was Nebuzaradan</a>. He had three hundred mule-loads 
of axes that cut iron, but one gate of Jerusalem swallowed them all. 
Nebuzaradan wanted to retreat, but the Heavenly voice told him, &#8220;You 
always wanted to destroy Jerusalem, now is your chance.&#8221; With the wooden
 handle of a hatchet he then destroyed all gates, conquered Jerusalem 
and burned the Temple.<br>
<br>
Nebuzaradan saw the blood of Zechariah, seething on the floor of the 
Temple. He asked, &#8220;What is it?&#8221; They told him, &#8220;Blood of offerings that 
spilled.&#8221; He brought offerings, but it did not look the same. He then 
threatened torture, and they told him the truth: Zechariah prophesied 
about the destruction of the Temple, and they killed him, a Kohen and a 
prophet. Nebuzaradan then brought the Sages and slew them over the 
blood, but it did not rest. He killed schoolchildren and Kohanim, and 
kept killing until the count came to 940,000. He then called to 
Zechariah, &#8220;Do you want me to kill everyone?&#8221; - and the blood rested.<br>
<br>
Nebuzaradan then reasoned, &#8220;If for killing one person God punished them 
so, what will He do to that man (meaning himself)?&#8221; He then sent a will 
to his household and converted to Judaism.<br>
