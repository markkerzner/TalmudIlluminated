<span style="font-size: medium;">An instigator 
might say, &#8220;There is a deity is such-and-such far-away place, thus it 
eats, thus it drinks, thus it benefits, thus it harms.&#8221; <br>
<br>
If he says his words to two persons, they are his witnesses, even 
without a warning, and they bring him to court and stone him. If he says
 his remarks to one person, that person can entrap him, saying &#8220;I have 
more friends who are interested.&#8221; If the instigator is clever and 
refuses, they arrange witnesses behind a partition and he asks the 
instigator to repeat his words in private. He then says, &#8220;How can we 
forget our God in Heaven and worship wood and stones?&#8221; If the instigator
 retracts, this is good, but if not, the witnesses behind the partition 
take him to court.<br>

A person named Yannai asked for a drink at a certain inn. He saw that 
the waitress's lips were moving and understood that she was engaged in 
sorcery. He poured off some liquid, and it turned into scorpions. He 
gave the waitress to drink and she became a donkey. He rode upon her and
 went out to the marketplace. Her friend came and dissolved the magic 
spell, and Yannai was thus seen riding upon a woman in the marketplace.<br>
