<span style="font-size: medium;">The judges asked 
the witnesses specific questions about the murder: &#8220;Did you recognize 
the victim?&#8221;, &#8220;Did you warn the murderer?&#8221; - The witnesses are asked if 
the accused acknowledged in their presence that he is forbidden to do 
the action he was performing.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Did he accept the warning upon himself?&#8221; - The offender must be 
apprised  of the particular form of execution he will suffer if he 
commits the prohibited act. Furthermore, he is not executed unless he 
declares that he plans to do the action, even though he knows that doing
 so will result in his execution.<br>
<br>
&#8220;Did he kill within as much time as needed to say a greeting of peace to
 one's teacher?&#8221; - If he commits the offense after this period has 
elapsed, he avoids punishment, since perhaps in the interim he has 
forgotten the warning.<br>
