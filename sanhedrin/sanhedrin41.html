Furthermore, he is not executed unless he declares that he plans to do the action, even though he knows that doing so will result in his execution. <br/> <br/> "Did he kill within as much time as needed to say a greeting of peace to one's teacher?" - If he commits the offense after this period has elapsed, he avoids punishment, since perhaps in the interim he has forgotten the warning. <br/> <br/> Art: Edouard Manet - The Execution of the Emperor Maximilian</body></html>
