<span style="font-size: medium;">The following are
 ineligible to be judges or witnesses: one who rolls dice (a gambler), 
one who lends on interest, one who bets on pigeon races, and one who 
does business with the produce of the seventh year. Rabbi Yehudah says, 
&#8220;When are the dice-players ineligible to adjudicate or testify? When 
they have no trade but this, but if they also have another trade, they 
are eligible.&#8221;<br>
<br>
Those who put personal gain above the law are suspect of accepting 
bribes, but what is the problem with gamblers? Rabbi Yehudah supposes 
that if all he does is gambling, then he is not knowledgeable neither in
 the law nor in the ways of commerce. Therefore, if he has another 
trade, he is eligible. The first Sage, however, considers gambling a 
form of theft: his customers don't really expect to loose, so when the 
gambler collect his wins, he is a robber.<br>
